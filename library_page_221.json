            "abstract": "This paper examines the within-market and cross-market information content of order flow for stocks, corporate bonds and Treasury bonds in China. With daily-aggregated tick-by-tick data over three years on the Shanghai Security Exchange, we find negative cross-asset effects of order flow on returns, both between stocks and bonds and between corporate and Treasury bonds. Our results provide evidence that not only cross-market portfolio rebalancing under general market conditions, but also flight-to-quality, which occurs particularly under extreme market conditions, are responsible for the cross-market effects of order flow. In particular, while Treasury bonds play a dominant role in stock-bond portfolio rebalancing, corporate bonds can replace Treasury bonds as a safe \u00c2\u00a1\u00c2\u00a7haven\u00c2\u00a1\u00c2\u00a8 during extreme stock market conditions or during a fall in Treasury bond market returns.",

            "abstract": "In this paper we examine the influence of private information on Asset Pricing. The main obstacle that we face when we use CAPM with private information is the unavailability of the observable variables that directly measure private information. Microstructure literature provides many models to estimate it. An important contribution in this way was moved forward by Easley, Kiefer, O'Hara and Paperman (1996). They estimate private information by probability of information-based trading (PIN). Our study concerns a sample of 40 quoted securities in Tunisian financial market, over the period going from January 02, 2010 until December 31, 2014, and results appear conclusive. Firstly, we show the existence of asset pricing bias compared to the standard CAPM. Secondly, we find a strong relation between private information (PIN), spread, buyer and seller trades returns. This is consistent with the idea of PIN capturing the probability of informed trading. Finally, the validity of PIN as measure of private information, gave us a motivation to test the validity of CAPM with private information cost based on Probability of Information-based Trading.",

Para tal fin, desde el punto de vista metodol\u00c3\u00b3gico se tomar\u00c3\u00a1 como referencia el marco te\u00c3\u00b3rico de media varianza, elaborado por Harry Markowitz y la funci\u00c3\u00b3n de utilidad neocl\u00c3\u00a1sica del consumo tipo Cobb-Douglas que establece una relaci\u00c3\u00b3n entre el consumo y la tenencia de vivienda. Como resultado de este estudio, se propone una tasa de alquiler \u00c3\u00b3ptima que incluye el riesgo de mercado y la aversi\u00c3\u00b3n al riesgo del inversionista, para obtener un portafolio eficiente y concluye que la vivienda propia puede generar alg\u00c3\u00ban tipo de rentabilidad o mantener su punto de equilibrio financiero, cuando el inversionista tiene la opci\u00c3\u00b3n de escoger entre la compra de vivienda o la inversi\u00c3\u00b3n de otro tipo de activos financieros de renta variable. Una limitaci\u00c3\u00b3n del estudio, fue no considerar la aversi\u00c3\u00b3n al riesgo del inversionista de manera subjetiva. Finalmente, la originalidad del art\u00c3\u00adculo, radica en incluir la rentabilidad de tener vivienda propia en el portafolio de inversi\u00c3\u00b3n de los hogares, considerando de manera simult\u00c3\u00a1nea la aversi\u00c3\u00b3n al riego y el riesgo de mercado cuando est\u00c3\u00a1 hipotecada.",

Para conseguir el objetivo usamos como metodolog\u00c3\u00ada un an\u00c3\u00a1lisis de series de tiempo multifactorial. En particular, buscamos verificar si las estrategias de inversi\u00c3\u00b3n de ciclos de corto plazo y las estrategias de inversi\u00c3\u00b3n de ciclos de largo plazo se observan en la Bolsa Mexicana de Valores. Usamos como muestra datos de la Bolsa Mexicana de Valores, del periodo de 1993 - 2006. Los resultados muestran evidencia estad\u00c3\u00adstica de oportunidades para estrategias de inversi\u00c3\u00b3n de ciclos de corto plazo, pero no para estrategias de inversi\u00c3\u00b3n de ciclos de largo plazo. Una de las implicaciones de estos hallazgos es que estos resultados se suman a los trabajos que cuestionan la hip\u00c3\u00b3tesis de mercados eficientes. En suma, este trabajo aporta m\u00c3\u00a1s evidencia a la literatura que ha encontrado una relaci\u00c3\u00b3n entre el sector financiero con la actividad econ\u00c3\u00b3mica, en particular se documenta evidencia de una relaci\u00c3\u00b3n entre el ciclo econ\u00c3\u00b3mico y estrategias de inversi\u00c3\u00b3n de corto plazo.",

            "abstract": "We use the Expected Lifetime Range (ELR) Ratio proposed in Shaik and Maheswaran (2018) to find evidence of mean reversion in the BRICS stock markets indices. We divide the sample period into pre-crisis, crisis, and post-subprime crisis data sets. We find that the BRICS stock market indices show mean reversion from 2001 to 2018. While before the subprime crisis, the indices followed a random walk, after the subprime crisis, the BRICS stock markets show mean reversion behavior and have become more predictable. We also conduct the Lo and Mackinlay variance Ratio test and find that the Expected Lifetime Range Ratio is better at detecting the presence of mean reversion.",

            "abstract": "Abstract This paper presents credit risk transmission patterns in Central and Eastern Europe by applying a new mix of methods on sovereign credit default swaps market. The degree of connectedness among sovereigns is examined around the European Central Bank unconventional monetary policy announcements. Although transmission patterns do not substantially change over time, we find that asset purchase programs contributed to spillover reduction in high credit risk networks mostly before the implementation of zero lower bound rate policy. The results suggest that over time unconventional monetary policies substantially decrease credit risk in the European Union, but positive spillover transmission to Central and Eastern Europe depends on markets\u00e2\u0080\u0099 promptness to incorporate information.",

A rational explanation for the effect may be due to VIX serving as an indicator of future economic conditions. Noting, however, that the VIX effect is detected on excess daily stock returns is suggestive that the results are driven by more than mere changes in investors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 expectations of economic fundamentals. We suggest, therefore, that investors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 mood, as reflected by VIX changes, mediates their reactions to analyst recommendation revisions, to wit, investors in good (bad) mood perceive positive (negative) future financial outcomes as more probable (whether indicative of future occurrences or not) and react more strongly to analyst recommendation upgrades (downgrades).",

A decomposition of the basis (the slope of the term-structure of futures prices) into expected risk premiums and expected changes in spot prices helps us shed some light on the different results across the futures and spot markets.

Our model and empirics both indicate that O/S is a stronger signal when short-sale costs are high or option leverage is low.

Drawing upon the psychology and communication literature, which documents that the end of popular TV series causes negative emotional reactions in large numbers of television viewers, I employ major TV series finales (between 1967 and 2012) as mood-altering events. I find that an increase in the fraction of Americans watching a TV show finale on a given day is immediately followed by a decrease in U.S. stock returns. This effect is stronger in small-cap and high-volatility stocks, whose pricing is more sensitive to sentiment, and is consistent with the hypothesis that negative mood reduces the demand for risky assets.",

The nonlinear machine learning models generate statistically and economically sizable profits in the long-short portfolios of equity options even after accounting for transaction costs. Although option-based characteristics are the most important standalone predictors, stock-based measures offer substantial incremental predictive power when considered alongside option-based characteristics. Finally, we provide compelling evidence that option return predictability is driven by informational frictions and option mispricing.Authors have furnished an Internet Appendix, which is available on the Oxford University Press Web site next to the link to the final published paper online.",
