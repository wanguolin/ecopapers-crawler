            "abstract": "Abstract This paper reports a study of the evolution of the intraday price discovery of the Chinese CSI 300 stock index futures, utilizing minute-by-minute data for the two consecutive periods of April 16, 2010\u00e2\u0080\u0093July 30, 2010 and August 2, 2010\u00e2\u0080\u0093June 15, 2011. Innovatively, the empirical analysis employs a no-arbitrage-based error correction model (ECM) between the index and the theoretical index implied by the futures\u00e2\u0080\u0099 price. It is found that futures followed the index in the first period, but evolved to lead the spot in the second period. Interestingly, however, futures led within 30 min of the spot\u00e2\u0080\u0099s opening in each trading day, even in the initial first period of the futures trading. Fortuitously, the ECM seems to yield reasonable estimates for the arbitrage cost.",

            "abstract": "Abstract This paper proposes a market-wide credit risk factor for the US stock market and investigates its properties that are dependent on economic conditions. The market price of credit risk is found to be statistically significantly negative, supporting earlier studies. However, a sample-split analysis reveals that this negative payoff is nonexistent in a later subsample, indicating that the credit risk puzzle is based on temporary mispricing related to the earlier subsample. Further investigation shows that mispricing in the earlier period was mainly driven by positive payoffs of low credit risk firms, while high credit risk firms did not generate significant returns in any of the sub-periods.",

We use the spread between two classes of ordinary shares of Royal Dutch Shell Plc, and two listings of Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited to observe market inefficient states. We find that the parameter of the waiting-time distribution provides a quantitative measure of the market inefficiency and can be used as a short-term market efficiency indicator. This approach can be applied to liquid financial markets and has clear implications for the investors, hedgers, regulators and policymakers.",

            "abstract": "Abstract We investigate the response of UK asset prices to a large set of domestic scheduled macroeconomic announcements using data at a daily frequency from 1998 to 2017. Our results are mostly consistent with economic theory and follow two general patterns: (1) a stronger-than-expected economy raises stock returns, causes the home currency to appreciate, makes the yield curve steeper, and lowers the corporate credit quality spread; (2) higher-than-anticipated inflation leads to an appreciation of the domestic currency and raises the slope of the yield curve. Surprises about retail sales, claimant count rate, GDP, and industrial production have the most prevalent effects across the four asset classes in our data set. A large number of macroeconomic announcements increase trading activity in the stock market, whereas there is barely any (only minor) evidence that announcements (surprises) affect the volatility of asset prices. We also document that the effects of macroeconomic surprises are contingent not only upon the state of the economy but also on the state of the stock market (bull vs. bear).",

The risk aversion of the market maker inevitably leads to price persistence that can be exploited by technical traders. \\\\ We conjecture that this can force a situation in which a market is informationally but not alloactively efficient. Adding more realism by imposing credit limits creates nonlinearities that can cause prices to oscillate even in the absence of external information.",

            "abstract": "Overreaction phenomena stimulate assets mispricing and return reversals. Investors should build a trading strategy to receive benefits from the anomaly. Developing the classic idea of overreaction hypothesis from DeBondt and Thaler (1985 and 1990), we build stock portfolios based on sentiment and risk to produce higher future stock return. Using Indonesian data, we use financial information from public information to test weak-form efficiency. We believe that investors are not always rational and other groups of investors can use public information to generate excess return. This article finds that lower PER tend to produce higher future return, especially if lower PER accompanied by lower risk. Practically, our study contributes to the use of fundamental analysis in emerging markets. Theoretically, this study supports the idea of behavioral finance theory and reject weak-form efficient market hypothesis in Indonesia Stock Exchange.",

For individual stocks, this correlation is moderate and decays exponentially over 50 days, while for stock indices, it is much stronger but decays faster. For individual stocks, the magnitude of this correlation has a universal value that can be rationalized in terms of a new `retarded' model which interpolates between a purely additive and a purely multiplicative stochastic process.

For individual stocks, the leverage correlation can be rationalized in terms of a new `retarded' model which interpolates between a purely additive and a purely multiplicative stochastic process. For stock indices a specific market panic phenomenon seems to be necessary to account for the observed amplitude of the effect. As for the increase of correlations in highly volatile periods, we investigate how much of this effect can be explained within a simple non-Gaussian one-factor description with time independent correlations. In particular, this one-factor model can explain the level and asymmetry of empirical exceedance correlations, which reflects the fat-tailed and negatively skewed distribution of market returns.",

Based on 5-minute returns of 13 stocks we examine how the strength and the significance of reaction of investors to unexpected macroeconomic news form the US has changed in the recent 15 years.
