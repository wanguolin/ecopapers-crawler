            "abstract": "Abstract This paper studies abnormal returns to mutual funds from using a firm fundamental trading strategy. We find that the abnormal returns and the Sharpe Ratio are higher for actively managed mutual funds holding fundamentally strong stocks. These results are driven by the lower risk of stocks with strong fundamentals rather than higher returns. Compared to benchmark index funds, actively managed mutual funds do not slant their portfolios towards fundamentally strong stocks. The lack of trading on firm fundamentals appears to be related to manager incentives as fund inflows are uncorrelated with changes in the fundamentals of their holding stocks.",

            "abstract": "Abstract When stocks are trading near their 52-week high investors tend to have low expectation about their future returns. We contrast such expectations against firms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 fundamental strength. For firms with strong fundamentals, we confirm that investors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 expectations are too low, which is consistent with the hypothesis that the 52-week high acts as a psychological anchor. We report that a fundamental-strength enhanced 52-week high trading strategy significantly outperform the unconditional strategy by nearly doubling its average return. Moreover, we provide interesting evidence that this anomalous effect is most evident when investor sentiment is high, but absent among more sophisticated institutions and short sellers.",

            "abstract": "We study seasonality in the two-year Treasury Note yields. We find that most anecdotally observed seasonal variations of yields do not pass the more rigorous statistical significance test. In addition, the seasonality findings depend on how me measure yields and what kind of seasonal patterns we test. No statistical significance is found with tests using nominal yields, most likely due to the fact that yields have been dropping substantially since the 1980s which distorted the mean values of yields. When we instead use the rank of monthly yields in a year to test the seasonality, however, we find strong statistical significance to support the variation of high yields from March to August and low yields from September to February",

            "abstract": "We study seasonalities in the yields of Treasury notes (T-Notes) with fixed maturities of two, three, five, seven and ten years. We find that although there are a number of anecdotal patterns, only one passes the more rigorous statistical tests, which is the half-year high (March to August) versus half-year low (September to February) yield measured in terms of their ranks in a year. The results across T-Notes of different maturities also exhibit a striking resemblance. Further analysis on the yield spread of the 10- Year and 2-Year T-Notes shows that although their nominal yield differences have been similar in recent economic cycles, the percentage values of the differences have been increasing quickly especially since the 2010s due to the low levels of short-term Treasury yields.",

            "abstract": "In this paper we test for the presence of fractional integration, or long memory, in the daily returns of exchange rates using ARFIMA(p,d,q) models. We consider 34 exchange rates against the US dollar (USD) covering the period April 1991 to April 2006. The results suggest that 17 exchange rates show strong evidence of long memory. This indicates that shocks to the exchange rates persist over a long period of time (this is stronger in emerging market economies). This also indicates that these markets are not stable, and hence they offer an opportunity to investors and traders to add some risk to their strategies. The lack of long memory in the daily returns of exchange rates supports the efficient market hypothesis (EMH). These findings are helpful to traders dealing with long dated assets.",

Berkshire Hathaway\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s dual class stock with differential voting rights and one- way conversion option provides a unique opportunity to investigate this issue while controlling for other exogenous variables that could bias the findings. Given the investor attention directed toward Berkshire Hathaway, and the company\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s famous CEO Warren Buffett, this company\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s stock should always trade in an efficient market. The results suggest that Berkshire Hathaway class B shares tend to have significantly higher opening prices and Berkshire Hathaway class A shares tend to have higher closing prices, although both A and B shares have similar average daily returns. Price dynamics may create unique arbitrage opportunities for investors. However, the higher overnight returns for B shares may be offset by higher volatility embedded in the B shares.",

Thirdly, this study presents an enhanced target price setting method to improve the target price reliability, this method provides effective solutions to the common but unsolved question about how to combine a range of value estimates.

As such, they should be valued by different valuation models. This study offers a comprehensive overview of the characteristics of financial and information technology industries and identifies the appropriate industry-specific valuation models for each industry. As the features of firms may still vary greatly even within the same industry, this study further classifies each industry into several sectors according to the Industry Classification Benchmark. After that, a series of corresponding valuation models for each sector are recommended. Detailed explanations for the recommendations are provided for each sector. This study contributes to the literature of valuation methodology by identifying the corresponding valuation models for different sectors/industries. More accurate estimation of intrinsic value can be expected as a result of more compatible valuation model.",

The portfolio average risk-adjusted excess returns are positive for the 3-year holding period intervals and statistically significant for the 5- year holding period.

The focus is on the change in the information structure/flow between these markets triggered by the 1997 Asian financial crisis. It is shown that the information structure during the crisis period was different from that in the non-crisis periods. While the U.S. market led the four East Asian markets before, during, and after the crisis, it was Granger-caused by these markets during the financial crisis period but not in the postcrisis sample. Further, in accordance with concerns reported in the market, the Japanese currency is found to have affected these equity markets during the crisis period. The Japanese yen effect, however, disappeared in the post-crisis sample. The Japanese currency effect is quite robust as it is found from both local currency and U.S. dollar return data and in the presence of Japanese stock returns.",

            "abstract": "Our basic premise is that fund managers performance is related to superior information about an asset payoff. We investigate the relationship between managerial skills and trading behavior within a two-period rational expectation equilibrium (REE) model where agents trade on private information in the first round, while a public signal arrives at the second date that makes traders revise their beliefs and retrade. The public signal can be related to the asset payoff, or to variables not related to fundamentals (noise), or both. We characterize the unique partially revealing REE and explore the drivers of price dynamics and trading behavior. Our main prediction is that good managers are contrarian traders, while bad managers are momentum traders when public news arrive to the market. Furthermore, the change in holdings of each type of trader is monotonic on the traders' skills. Based on these predictions, we propose new performance evaluation measures that rely on the manager's change in holdings around the arrival of public news rather than his past performance. A byproduct of our analysis is the proposal of a new protocol for performance evaluation and Due Diligence (DD) procedures.",
