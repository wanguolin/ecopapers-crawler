            "abstract": "The purpose of this paper is to examine the performance of an important set of momentum-based technical trading rules (TTRs) applied to all members of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) stock index over the period 1928\u00e2\u0080\u00932012. Using a set of econometric models that permit time-variation in risk-adjusted returns to TTR portfolios, the results reveal that profits evolve slowly over time, are confined to particular episodes primarily from the mid-1960s to mid-1980s, and rely on the ability of investors to short-sell stocks. These findings are demonstrated to be consistent with theoretical models that predict a relationship between TTR performance and market conditions.",

            "abstract": "This paper provides new evidence concerning the probability of informed trading (PIN) and the PIN-return relationship. We take measures to overcome known estimation biases and improve the quality of quarterly PIN estimates. We use the average of a firm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s PIN estimates in four consecutive quarters to smooth out the effect of seasonal variation in trading activities. We find that when high-quality PIN estimates are used, the Fama\u00e2\u0080\u0093MacBeth cross-sectional regressions show stronger evidence for the positive PIN-return relationship than documented in the prior literature. This finding is robust to controls for the January, liquidity, and momentum effects.",

To answer this, we investigate a comprehensive dataset of more than two centuries of returns on five major asset classes: equity indices, government bonds, treasury bills, commodities, and currencies. Contrary to stock-level evidence, we find a striking short-term momentum pattern: the most recent month\u00e2\u0080\u0099s return positively predicts future performance. The effect is not explained by established return predictors\u00e2\u0080\u0094including the standard momentum\u00e2\u0080\u0094and is robust to many considerations. The short-term momentum is strongest among assets of high idiosyncratic volatility and in periods of elevated return dispersion. Also, the strategy payoffs display partial commonality across different asset classes.",

We find that the risk-neutral skewness has the explanatory power regarding future volatility only during high sentiment periods. Furthermore, the implied volatility has varying volatility forecasting ability depending on the level of investor sentiment. Our findings suggest that the effectiveness of volatility forecasting models based on option-implied information varies over time with the level of investor sentiment. We confirm the important role of investor sentiment in volatility forecasting models exploiting option-implied information with strong evidence from in-sample and out-of-sample analyses. We also present improvements in the accuracy of volatility forecasts from volatility forecasting models derived by incorporating investor sentiment in these models.",

By estimating the joint multivariate distribution of both returns and bid-ask spreads from intraday data, we incorporate the measurement of commonalities in liquidity and comovements of stocks and bid-ask spreads into the forecasting of three types of liquidity-adjusted intraday Value-at-Risk (L-IVaR). In a preliminary analysis, we document strong extreme comovements in liquidity and strong tail dependence between bid-ask spreads and log returns across the firms in our sample thus motivating our use of a vine copula model. Furthermore, the backtesting results for the L-IVaR of a portfolio consisting of five stocks listed on the NASDAQ show that the proposed models perform well in forecasting liquidity-adjusted intraday portfolio profits and losses.",

            "abstract": "Building on prior literature which suggests that investors in most countries, but not Japan, are subject to behavioural biases that cause momentum, and informed by the shared cultural values in Japan which leans heavily in favour of collective action, this paper asks whether stock return patterns following revisions to the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s flagship index are driven by behavioural manifestations of cultural traits specific to investors there. We find that herd-like overreaction, accompanied by strong reversals, cause stocks added to the index to underperform the market over the long term. Our findings contrast sharply with existing evidence that momentum effects drive the outperformance of stocks added to U.S.-domiciled indexes over similar horizons. Overall, the findings not only offer support to the notion that investors in different national cultures respond differently to an information shock and are subject to different cognitive biases, but also highlight the role of collective sentiment in investor decision-making around index revisions.",

The impact of the stock returns' size is also examined and the validity of models explaining the observed negative relations between asset returns and inflation are addressed. The generalized impulse response functions are adopted. Further, The vector error correction model (VECM) (Johansen (1991)) is utilized to determine the impact of selected macroeconomic variables on NYSE. Results reveal that size had an impact on stock returns. Further, it appears that there is reliable negative relationship between stock prices and inflation. The level of real economic activity affects stock prices positively. Finally, interest rates have a negative relationship with stock prices",

Using an extensive list of anomaly variables, we find that the long-short strategy of buying (shorting) stocks with high (low) deep learning signals generates greater returns for stocks more vulnerable to behavioral biases, i.e., small, young, unprofitable, volatile, non-dividend-paying, close-to-default, and lottery-like stocks. This performance of deep learning models for speculative stocks becomes pronounced when investor sentiment is high, and when new information is delivered through earnings announcements. Moreover, our nonlinear deep learning signals are negatively associated with analysts\u00e2\u0080\u0099 earnings forecast error especially for speculative stocks, implying that analysts\u00e2\u0080\u0099 forecasts are too low for speculative stocks with high deep learning signals. These results suggest that deep learning models with nonlinear structures are useful for capturing mispricing induced by behavioral biases.",

            "abstract": "Evidence suggests that rational, periodically collapsing speculative bubbles may be pervasive in stock markets globally, but there is no research that considers them at the individual stock level. In this study we develop and test an empirical asset pricing model that allows for speculative bubbles to affect stock returns. We show that stocks incorporating larger bubbles yield higher returns. The bubble deviation, at the stock level as opposed to the industry or market level, is a priced source of risk that is separate from the standard market risk, size and value factors. We demonstrate that much of the common variation in stock returns that can be attributable to market risk is due to the co-movement of bubbles rather than being driven by fundamentals.",

We show that the early-stage (late-stage) momentum strategy of buying identified early-stage (late-stage) winners and selling identified early-stage (late-stage) losers outperforms (underperforms) the conventional momentum strategy of buying winners and selling losers across all momentum stages. We also find that the price momentum of the early-stage (late-stage) momentum strategy experiences slower (faster) reversal than that of the conventional momentum strategy. The outperformance of the early-stage momentum strategy comes primarily from the contribution of losers, as options-implied measures better place losers in their momentum stages than winners. Moreover, the identification ability of options-implied measures increases with the informativeness of the options market and, more importantly, is driven by their predictive information about a firm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fundamentals, particularly for profitability.
