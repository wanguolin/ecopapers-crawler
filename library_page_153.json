            "title": "Financial Asset Returns, Market Timing, and Volatility Dynamics",
            "abstract": "We consider three sets of phenomena that feature prominently and separately in the financial economics literature: conditional mean dependence (or lack thereof) in asset returns, dependence (and hence forecastability) in asset return signs with implications for market timing, and dependence (and hence forecastability) in asset return volatilities. We show that they are very much interrelated, and we explore the relationships in detail. Among other things, we show that: (1) Volatility dependence produces sign dependence, so long as expected returns are nonzero. Hence one should expect sign dependence, given the overwhelming evidence of volatility dependence. (2) The standard finding of little or no conditional mean dependence is entirely consistent with a significant degree of sign dependence and volatility dependence. In particular, sign dependence does not imply market inefficiency. (3) Sign dependence is not likely to be found via analysis of sign autocorrelations, because the nature of sign dependence is highly nonlinear. (4) Sign dependence is not likely to be found in very high-frequency (e.g., daily) or very low-frequency (e.g., annual) returns. Instead, it is more likely to be found at intermediate return horizons. Nous consid\u00c3\u00a9rons trois ensembles de ph\u00c3\u00a9nom\u00c3\u00a8nes qui sont souvent - et s\u00c3\u00a9par\u00c3\u00a9ment - discut\u00c3\u00a9s dans la litt\u00c3\u00a9rature d'\u00c3\u00a9conomie financi\u00c3\u00a8re, \u00c3 savoir la d\u00c3\u00a9pendance de la moyenne conditionnelle (ou l'absence de d\u00c3\u00a9pendance) dans les rendements d'actifs, la d\u00c3\u00a9pendance (et donc pr\u00c3\u00a9visibilit\u00c3\u00a9) des signes de rendements d'actifs ainsi que leurs implications dans le timing du march\u00c3\u00a9, et la d\u00c3\u00a9pendance (et donc pr\u00c3\u00a9visibilit\u00c3\u00a9) dans les volatilit\u00c3\u00a9s des rendements d'actifs. Nous montrons que ces ph\u00c3\u00a9nom\u00c3\u00a8nes sont \u00c3\u00a9troitement interreli\u00c3\u00a9s et nous explorons leurs relations en d\u00c3\u00a9tail. Entre autres, nous montrons que : 1) la d\u00c3\u00a9pendance de la volatilit\u00c3\u00a9 produit une d\u00c3\u00a9pendance du signe tant que les rendements attendus sont non nuls. On devrait par cons\u00c3\u00a9quent s attendre \u00c3 une d\u00c3\u00a9pendance du signe, \u00c3\u00a9tant donn\u00c3\u00a9 la pr\u00c3\u00a9sence notoire de d\u00c3\u00a9pendance de volatilit\u00c3\u00a9; 2) le r\u00c3\u00a9sultat classique qui ne trouve que peu ou pas de d\u00c3\u00a9pendance de la moyenne conditionnelle est parfaitement compatible avec un degr\u00c3\u00a9 significatif de d\u00c3\u00a9pendance de signe et de d\u00c3\u00a9pendance de volatilit\u00c3\u00a9. En particulier, la d\u00c3\u00a9pendance de signe n'implique pas une inefficacit\u00c3\u00a9 du march\u00c3\u00a9; 3) Il est peu probable qu'une analyse des autocorr\u00c3\u00a9lations de signes r\u00c3\u00a9v\u00c3\u00a8le une d\u00c3\u00a9pendance de signe, parce que la nature de la d\u00c3\u00a9pendance du signe est fortement non lin\u00c3\u00a9aire; 4) il est \u00c3\u00a9galement peu probable que l'on retrouve une d\u00c3\u00a9pendance de signe dans des rendements \u00c3 tr\u00c3\u00a8s haute fr\u00c3\u00a9quence (par exemple quotidiens) ou \u00c3 tr\u00c3\u00a8s basse fr\u00c3\u00a9quence (par exemple annuels).

            "abstract": "We study the different origins of two closely related extreme financial risk factors: volatility bursts and price jumps. We propose a new method to separate these quantities from ultra-high-frequency data via a novel endogenous thresholding approach in the presence of market microstructure noise and staleness. Our daily jump statistic proxies volatility bursts when intraday jumps are accurately controlled by our local jump test (which proves to be highly powerful with extremely low misclassification rates due to its timely detections). We find that news is more related to volatility bursts; while high-frequency trading variables, especially volume and bid/ask spread, are prominent signals for price jumps.",

            "abstract": "In recent years there has been a tremendous growth in the influx of news related to traded assets in international financial markets. This financial news is now available via print media but also through real-time online sources such as internet news and social media sources. The increase in the availability of financial news and investor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ease of access to it has a potentially significant impact on market price formation as these news items are swiftly transformed into investors sentiment which in turn drives prices. Various commercial agencies have started developing their own financial news data sets which are used by investors and traders to support their algorithmic trading strategies. Thomson Reuters News Analytics (TRNA)1 is one such data set. In this study we use the TRNA data set to construct a series of daily sentiment scores for Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) stock index component companies. We use these daily DJIA market sentiment scores to study the influence of financial news sentiment scores on the stock prices of these companies using a multi-factor model. We use an augmented Fama French Three Factor Model to evaluate the additional effects of financial news sentiment on stock prices in the context of this model. Our results suggest that even when market factors are taken into account, sentiment scores have a significant effect on Dow Jones constituent company returns and that lagged daily sentiment scores are often significant, suggesting that information compounded in these scores is not immediately reflected in security prices and related return series.",

Therefore, the present study examines factors affecting NFT returns, from market-related factors (crypto-market index return and stock market index return) to the Amihud illiquidity ratio and Google search trends during different market conditions. The wavelet coherences-based methodology was applied separately during the boom, bust, normal, and turbulent periods identified by structural breakpoints. Based on 14 NFT projects between April 2019 and July 2022, results show two fundamental asymmetries influencing these NFT returns. First, there is an asymmetry in the behavior of the factors in different periods; second, there is an asymmetry in how illiquidity manifests itself over NFTs that do or do not possess cash flow-generating potential.",

            "abstract": "Abstract The effect of investor sentiment on stock volatility is a highly attractive research question in both the academic field and the real financial industry. With the proposal of China's \"dual carbon\" target, green stocks have gradually become an essential branch of Chinese stock markets. Focusing on 106 stocks from the new energy, environmental protection, and carbon\u00e2\u0080\u0093neutral sectors, we construct two investor sentiment proxies using Internet text and stock trading data, respectively. The Internet sentiment is based on posts from Eastmoney Guba, and the trading sentiment comes from a variety of trading indicators. In addition, we divide the realized volatility into continuous and jump parts, and then investigate the effects of investor sentiment on different types of volatilities. Our empirical findings show that both sentiment indices impose significant positive impacts on realized, continuous, and jump volatilities, where trading sentiment is the main factor. We further explore the mediating effect of information asymmetry, measured by the volume-synchronized probability of informed trading (VPIN), on the path of investor sentiment affecting stock volatility. It is evidenced that investor sentiments are positively correlated with the VPIN, and they can affect volatilities through the VPIN. We then divide the total sample around the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The empirical results reveal that the market volatility after the COVID-19 pandemic is more susceptible to investor sentiments, especially to Internet sentiment. Our study is of great significance for maintaining the stability of green stock markets and reducing market volatility.",

            "abstract": "Abstract This study investigates tail dependence among five major cryptocurrencies, namely Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Ripple, and Bitcoin Cash, and uncertainties in the gold, oil, and equity markets. Using the cross-quantilogram method and quantile connectedness approach, we identify cross-quantile interdependence between the analyzed variables. Our results show that the spillover between cryptocurrencies and volatility indices for the major traditional markets varies substantially across quantiles, implying that diversification benefits for these assets may differ widely across normal and extreme market conditions. Under normal market conditions, the total connectedness index is moderate and falls below the elevated values observed under bearish and bullish market conditions. Moreover, we show that under all market conditions, cryptocurrencies have a leadership influence over the volatility indices. Our results have important policy implications for enhancing financial stability and deliver valuable insights for deploying volatility-based financial instruments that can potentially provide cryptocurrency investors with suitable hedges, as we show that cryptocurrency and volatility markets are insignificantly (weakly) connected under normal (extreme) market conditions.",

However, large stocks exhibit intra-industry reversals, in which industry winners underperform industry losers in the subsequent month, when controlling for price momentum. Conversely, once this intra-industry reversal is neutralised, large stocks display momentum behaviour, in which market winners outperform market losers. These conditional strategies generate positive, significant risk-adjusted returns on large stocks in Australia. This paper documents significant industry momentum, as winning industries outperform losing industries in the following month. This industry momentum effect dominates the intra-industry reversal. The paper also finds evidence that conditional reversals are driven by illiquidity and are inhibited by stock prices under-reacting to earnings announcements.",

            "abstract": "Studies on the financial markets proved that not all calendar anomalies are persistent in time. Some of them experienced various types of changes, including passing from the classical form to an extended one, with an enlarged specific time interval. This paper approaches the Holiday Effect extended form on the United States capital market. In its classical form, the Holiday Effect refers to abnormal stock returns on a trading day before a public holiday and a trading day after. We study the behavior of stocks returns for a time interval that starts four trading days before a public holiday and it ends four trading days after. In this investigation we employ the daily closing values of four important indexes from the United States capital market: Dow Jones Industrial Average, Standard & Poor's 500, Russell 2000 and NASDAQ Composite. In order to capture the changes experienced in time by the Extended Holiday Effect we analyze the returns of these indexes for three periods: January 1990 - December 1999, January 2000 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 December 2009 and January 2010 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 April 2020. The investigation revealed, for some trading days from the enlarged specific time interval, returns that were, in average, significant larger or smaller than those of the days outside of this interval. We found especially high abnormal returns on four or three trading days before public holidays and low abnormal returns on one or two trading days after public holidays. The results also suggest that the Extended Holiday Effect was more visible in relative quiet periods than in the turbulent ones and it influences especially the stock returns of small cap companies.",

The research aims to broaden academic knowledge in a few ways. Firstly, we deliver some fresh evidence on the low price effect from the Polish market. Secondly, we analyze the interdependence between the low price effect and other return factors: value, size and liquidity. Thirdly, we investigate whether the low price effect is present after accounting for liquidity. Fourthly, we check to see whether the low price effect is robust to transaction costs. The paper is composed of three main sections. In the beginning, we review the existing literature. Next, we present the data sources and research methods employed. Finally, we discuss our research findings. Our computations are based on all the stocks listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange (WSE) in the years 2003-2013. We have concluded that the low price effect is present on the Polish market, although the statistical significance is very weak and it disappears entirely after accounting for transaction costs and liquidity.",

            "abstract": "An efficient market should not show any anomalies. When new information reaches a market which is efficient, it should automatically translate into prices of assets, which ought to eliminate the possibility of gaining an advantage over other investors, thus preventing excess profits. However, studies on capital markets indicate that in reality it is possible to earn unusually high profits by taking advantage of certain anomalies which occur on a given market. Among such anomalies there is the momentum effect. This study performed on the Stock Exchange in Warsaw has shown that the momentum effect occurred throughout the entire analyzed time period. Positive returns demonstrated for investment strategies based on the momentum effect were unexplainable by the classical theory of finances. A correlation was found between the economic situation on the stock exchange and portfolio return rates, but it was too weak to attribute the effect to a single decisive factor. In addition, the returns from investments based on the momentum effect were statistically higher in January than in the other months, which was caused by the January effect, stimulating the occurrence of statistically higher returns at the beginning of a year rather than later on during the analyzed period of time. Research in this field carried out in other countries justifies the claim that there are many irrational factors which together create the momentum effect on the stock exchange. Thus, it is possible to conclude that irrational decisions may have strong impact on the pricing of stocks on the capital market. The momentum effect persisted throughout the entire analyzed period, although its power changed cyclically, which coincides with results of research carried out in other countries. The fact that the momentum effect did not disappear may suggest that the factors involved in its creation are an indispensable part of the market, and this seems to undermine the commonly accepted hypothesis about the efficiency of capital markets.",
