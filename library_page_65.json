            "title": "Consequences of Voluntary Stock Exchange Section Switching on Stock Prices, Liquidity and Volatility",
            "abstract": "The decision to switch stock exchange section is an important, but one of the least studied questions in the litterature. especially for voluntary transfer decisions. Managers believe that switching the trading compartment of their common stocks to a more important one creates value for their firms by improving visibility, stocks\u00e2\u0080\u0099 liquidity and raising capital at lower cost. In this article, we examine market reactions around trading compartment switchings. The results, in general, indicate a positive market reaction around the transfer announcement and an improvement of stock liquidity after that date. However, the market reaction weakens significantly after admission to the new stock exchange section. Our findings also reveal a link between stock price reaction to a compartment transfer and the pre-transfer liquidity level. Finally, we highlight that compartment transfer reduces volatility of switching stocks, owing to the decrease in the firm-specific risk rather than the systematic risk.",

            "abstract": "Behavioral finance is a field that has grown toward the end of 20th century as a reaction to the efficient market hypothesis. This new field studies the effect of investor psychology on financial decisions and explains stock market anomalies in financial markets. Herding is such an anomaly that is defined as mimicking others? decisions or market trend.The aim of the study is to detect whether there is herding or not in Borsa Istanbul. To test the existence of herding, stock returns traded on Borsa Istanbul and BIST 100 Index as market indicator are used. Data covers daily returns from 1988 to 2014 and intraday returns from 1995 to 2014. Herd behavior is analyzed based on the methodology of cross-sectional dispersion of the stocks developed by Christie and Huang (1995) and Chang, Cheng and Khorana (2000). The results indicate that there is no herding for both up and down markets for daily and intraday intervals in Borsa Istanbul. However, tendency of herding is higher in up markets.",

            "abstract": "This paper develops an empirical and theoretical case for how `hype' among retail investors can drive large asset fluctuations. We use the dataset of discussions on WallStreetBets (WSB), an online investor forum with over nine million followers as of April 2021, to show how excitement about trading opportunities can ripple through an investor community with large market impacts. This paper finds empirical evidence of psychological contagion among retail investors by exploiting differences in stock price fluctuations and discussion intensity. We show that asset discussions on WSB are self-perpetuating: an initial set of investors attracts a larger and larger group of excited followers. Sentiments about future stock performance also spread from one individual to the next, net of any fundamental price movements. Leveraging these findings, we develop a model for how social contagion impacts prices. The proposed model and simulations show that social contagion has a destabilizing effect on markets. Finally, we establish a causal relationship between WSB activity and financial markets using an instrumental variable approach.",

The textual analysis negative (pessimism) percentage per se, as used in the previous literature, is not a significant determinant of future stock returns. But, monthly portfolios based on the product of annual pessimism change and the previous period returns generate returns in excess of previous winners/losers. Nine months after the filing, the difference is higher than 5%, while it surpasses 7% twelve months after the filing. Negative (positive) previous returns along with positive pessimism changes lead to positive (negative) returns.",

            "abstract": "We test whether news contained in macroeconomic announcements (MEAs) is priced in the cross-section of stock returns. When including news on a set of widely followed individual macroeconomic fundamentals in the cross-section of stock returns, estimates of their prices of risk are consistent with the explanation that good news on the economy is bad news for stocks during expansions. In contrast, during contractions, good news on the economy is good news for stocks as well. We find, however, that for most macroeconomic news events, their prices of risk are estimated imprecisely due to lack of data.",

            "abstract": "The study investigated the relationship between crude oil price, and Banking Sector stock prices in Nigeria from 2009 to 2016, using quarterly data collected from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and Nigeria Stock Exchange. Index of the Nigeria stock exchange for Banking Sector index was considered as dependent variables. The study implemented nonlinear ARDL (NARDL) which is an asymmetric extension of the standard co-integration test and the standard ARDL. The NARDL was applied to determine asymmetric effect of crude oil price shocks on stock prices. Findings from the analysis indicated the presence of long-run co-integration in most cases and that positive and negative oil price shocks have differential effects on banking sector index than negative oil price shocks of the same magnitude. Oil price shocks completely transmitted to the sector. The study concluded that there should be close monitoring of the banking sectors as well as appropriate policy actions to curtail systematic risk in the sector since oil price shocks transmits to oil and gas share prices listed on the Nigeria Stock Exchange.",

We take the Indian general election years of 2009, 2014, and 2019 and demonstrate how the unique circumstances before the elections affect the absorption of election sentiments and how this method can be used to find and foresee the effect of other such events through a detailed analysis of eigenfunctions.",

            "abstract": "Tracking endogenous fluctuations in stock prices emerged as a key challenge for empirical work in behavioural and evolutionary finance. This paper uses new data from an online discussion forum, Reddit, to quantify social contagion, or `hype,' in specific stock market movements, using state of the art opinion dynamics modelling and sentiment analysis. The influence between users on the WallStreetBets (WSB) subreddit is measured by tracing the probability of a user starting a fresh discussion on an asset given their previous involvement in a discussion on the same asset, measured by their comment history. This paper finds that users who comment on one discussion involving a particular asset are approximately four times more likely to start a new discussion about this asset in the future, with the probability increasing with each additional discussion the user engages in. This is a strong indication that investment strategies are reproduced through social interaction. This is further validated by findings that sentiments expressed in the linked submissions are strongly correlated in a set of spatial regression models. In particular, bearish sentiments seem to spread more than their bullish counterparts.",

A January effect is detected, together with a variant of the Turn-Of-The-Month effect, in that volatility tends to increase towards the end of the month. Whilst these effects may be attributed to sources identified in previous literature, it is also shown that this seasonality is related to announcement patterns of listed companies.",

Put-call-futures parity for the USD-INR currency options is studied by analyzing daily closing prices of options and futures for thirty two months on the National Stock Exchange. The study reveals frequent violations of the put-call-futures parity creating significant arbitrage opportunities.

These observations are consistent with those of studies of other young markets.",

We find that uncertainty (implied volatility) and asymmetric uncertainty (options skew) increase monotonically before the EA day and decrease after EA. Options volume (relative to spot and to futures) also exhibits similar behavior, suggesting that informed investors prefer options markets to spot and futures markets. Both options skew and put-to-call volume ratio can predict the sign of the EA surprise one day before EA, indicating that price discovery and information assimilation happen in the options market.",
