            "abstract": "This paper analyzes CSI 300 index and its 300 constituent stocks with seven market efficiency measures: autocorrelation of daily returns, autocorrelation of absolute daily returns, runs test, forecast ability of other historical data on daily return (the predictive ability of yesterday fs change of trading volume on today fs return in this paper), the return of specific trading strategy, variance ratio and pricing errors contained in daily return. We do a Principal component analysis to convert these indicators to a single indicator representing the market efficiency. Then we try to find the co-movement among different measures through correlation coefficient and among different stocks through OLS regression: market efficiency values of individual stocks are regressed on market efficiency values of CSI 300 for seven measures respectively. We found that different market efficiency measures are indeed consistent to each other to some extent and the individual stocks are somewhat consistent with the whole market indicating there is a systematic market efficiency in stock market in China. Our finding also support the idea that the market efficiency in Chinese stock market is changing all time without showing a clear upward trend from 2005 to 2020. In the end, we set three hypotheses to explain relatively high level of market efficiency in 2005, 2012, 2017 and 2019: the ability of market detecting and reacting to pricing errors, public information or private information is becoming quickly and accurately. We found that when the market is in a bad condition, the market contains more pricing-errors in daily returns and the ability of market detecting and reacting to private information is also bad.",

Using GARCH methodology, our results are similar with the results of the previous empirical literature that proved that the accounting information brings new and relevant information for the investors and highlight in the same time the importance of disclosure regulation for the development of stock markets.",

            "abstract": "Recent evidence on state-dependent variations in market liquidity suggests strong variations in the illiquidity premium across economic states. Adopting a two-state Markov switching model, we find that, while illiquid stocks are affected more by economic conditions than liquid ones are during recessions, the differences in expected returns are relatively small during expansions. Therefore, the expected illiquidity premium displays strong state-dependent variations that are countercyclical. We show that the state of a high illiquidity premium is closely associated with periods of real economic recessions, market declines, and high volatility, which coincides with major events of liquidity dry-up and high liquidity commonality.",

            "abstract": "This paper examines how the informational efficiency of the Japanese stock markets changed with the introduction of ETFs(Exchange-Traded Funds) by looking at the arbitrage relationships between cash and futures of the Nikkei225. This paper is unique in that it uses tick data, which enable me to measure the degree of arbitrage by four indexes: 1) the frequency and 2) the size of the deviations from non-arbitrage condition, which reflects the magnitude of arbitrage opportunities, 3) the frequency of arbitrage transactions as a measures of the intensity of arbitrage activities and 4) the time during a deviation from non-arbitrage condition for an indicator of the achieved informational efficiency. I found that the frequency and the size of the deviations as well as the frequency of arbitrage transactions increased significantly. However, the deviation time did not change. These results suggest that while arbitrage opportunities increased, the intensified arbitrage activities balanced out it, resulting in the invariant time of deviation.",

            "abstract": "This article shows that commodity portfolios that capture the backwardation and contango phases exhibit in-sample and out-of-sample predictive power for the first two moments of the distribution of long-horizon aggregate equity market returns, and for the business cycle. It also demonstrates that a pricing model based on the corresponding backwardation and contango risk factors explains relatively well a wide cross-section of equity portfolios. The cross-sectional \u00e2\u0080\u009chedging\u00e2\u0080\u009d risk prices are economically consistent with the direction of long-horizon predictability.

            "abstract": "We empirically examine the impact of industry exchange-traded funds (IETFs) on informed trading and market efficiency. We find that IETF short interest spikes simultaneously with hedge fund holdings on the member stock before positive earnings surprises, reflecting long-the-stock/short-the-ETF activity. This pattern is stronger among stocks with high industry risk exposure. A difference-in-difference analysis on the ETF inception event shows that IETFs reduce post-earnings-announcement drift more among stocks with high industry risk exposure, suggesting that IETFs improve market efficiency. We also find that the short interest ratio of IETFs positively predicts IETF returns, consistent with the hedging role of IETFs.",

Building on an existing theoretical model of information and investment choice, we estimate a learning index that reflects the expected benefits of learning about an asset. High learning index stocks have lower future returns and risk compared to low learning index stocks. Analysis of a conditional asset pricing model, long-run patterns in returns and volatilities, other measures of information flow, and the information environment surrounding earnings announcements reinforce our interpretation of the learning index. Our findings support the model\u00e2\u0080\u0099s predictions and illustrate a novel empirical measure of investor learning.",

The model\u00e2\u0080\u0099s parameters are structurally estimated using daily NYSE market-maker inventories, retail order flows, and prices. The estimated model fits empirical variances, autocorrelations, and cross-autocorrelations among our three data series from daily to monthly frequencies. Pricing errors for the typical NYSE stock have a standard deviation of 3.2 percentage points and a half-life of 6.2 weeks. These pricing errors account for 9.4, 7.0, and 4.5 of the respective daily, monthly, and quarterly idiosyncratic return variances.",

They therefore decompose five-year changes in firms\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 book-to-market ratios into stock returns and a residual that is a proxy for tangible information based on accounting performance (\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093book returns\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac ). Consistent with investors overreacting to intangible information, they find that only stock returns orthogonal to book returns reverse. We show that their decomposition creates a book return polluted by past book-to-market ratios, stock returns, net issuances, and dividends. Empirically, twofifths of the variation in book returns is due to these factors. In addition, the Daniel and Titman (2006) result is sensitive to methodological choices. When we use the change in the book value of equity as a proxy for tangible information, only the tangible component of stock returns reverses. Moreover, current book-to-market subsumes the intangible return\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s power to predict the cross-section of average returns, which casts doubt on the argument that book-to-market forecasts returns because it is a good proxy for the intangible return.",

            "abstract": "Studies of the seasonality of ETFs are relatively scarce compared with other financial assets. Moreover, most of the existing literature on ETFs did not assess the seasonality patterns of risk-adjusted returns and tracking error. This article seeks to suppress some of these gaps. The results provide evidence of a first-half of the year effect (higher returns), an outperformance of the second quarter and an underperformance of the fourth quarter compared with the remaining quarters, and higher (lower) returns in the first (third) month of the quarter vs the other months of the quarter. Furthermore, April exhibits a superior and December an inferior performance compared with the remaining months. Besides, higher (lower) returns on Wednesdays (Fridays) were observed compared with the other weekdays. Regarding the tracking error, some seasonal patterns are also reported. For example, the replication was more accurate in April than it was in remaining months and in the first month of each quarter. Finally, the effects detected in ETFs returns were not reflected in indices returns, with the exception of the April effect, indicating that the main seasonality patterns detected are caused by idiosyncratic ETFs factors and not to the constituents of the underlying indices.",

A real-time trading strategy is introduced based on the assumption that reversion occurs in later periods. The fundamental price is constructed in real time using the net present value approach which requires the series for expected dividends, expected returns and expected dividend growth rate. These series, typically unobservable, are derived from a structural state space model. A battery of tests comparing the rule to the passive Buy and Hold Strategy illustrates that the rule is marginally better for shorter horizons.",

Using various generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity models; this study reveals the different anomaly patterns in this market for before, during and after the Asian financial crisis periods. Among other important findings, the evidence of negative Monday returns in post-crisis period is consistent with the related literature. However, this study finds no evidence of a January effect or any other monthly seasonality. The current empirical findings on the mean returns and their volatility in the Malaysian stock market could be useful in designing trading strategies and drawing investment decisions. For instance, as there appears to be no month-of-the-year effect, long-term investors may adopt the buy-and-hold strategy in the Malaysia stock market to obtain normal returns. In contrast, to obtain abnormal profit, investors have to deliberately looking for short-run misaligned price due to varying market volatility based on the finding of day-of-the-week effect. Besides, investors can use the day-of-the-week effect information to avoid and reduce the risk when investing in the Malaysian stock market. Further analysis using EGARCH and TGARCH models uncovered that asymmetrical market reactions on the positive and negative news, rendering doubts on the appropriateness of the previous research that employed GARCH and GARCH-M models in their analysis of calendar anomalies as the later two models assume asymmetrical market reactions.",
