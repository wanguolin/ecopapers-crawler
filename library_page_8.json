            "abstract": "We find that firms experiencing improvements in crowdsourced employer ratings significantly outperform firms with declines. The return effect is concentrated among reviews from current employees, stronger among early firm reviews, and also stronger when the employee works in the headquarters state. Decomposing employer ratings, we find the return effect is related to changing employee assessments of Career Opportunities and views of senior management. It is unrelated to work-life balance. Employer rating changes are associated with growth in sales and profitability and help forecast one-quarter-ahead earnings announcement surprises. The evidence is consistent with employee reviews revealing fundamental information about the firm.",

We show that the bivariate regressions in this literature provide little information about the economic magnitude of excess comovement, with coefficients that are sensitive to unrelated factors. Using robust univariate regressions and matched control samples, almost all evidence of excess comovement disappears. In both examples, the stocks exhibit strong returns prior to the event, akin to momentum winners. We document that winner stocks exhibit increases in betas, generating much of the apparent excess comovement.",

            "abstract": "This study examines the co-movements between price returns of precious metals (gold and silver) and non-ferrous metals (aluminium, copper, Lead and zinc). To do this, we use the spillover index developed by Diebold and Yilmaz (2012) and various wavelet. The results show that aluminum is the highest contributor to shocks in the other metal markets whereas Lead and copper are the least contributors. Moreover, silver, copper, zinc and Lead are net receivers of shocks while gold and aluminium are net contributors to shocks in the other markets. In addition, the trajectory of the spillover index among all metals under investigation is influenced by economic crises. On the other hand, the results of wavelet methods reveal strong co-movements between precious and non-ferrous metals under medium and low frequencies where gold and silver are leading the non-ferrous metals. Besides, precious metal-non-ferrous metal pairs are in phase. The results show strong multiscale co-movements among non-ferrous metals. Gold offers better diversification benefits to non-ferrous metals under 2\u00e2\u0080\u00934 days. The diversification benefits decrease as scale rise. These findings are interesting and entail significant implications to investors, portfolio managers, and policy-makers to inform their decision-making.",

The results show significant lower tail dependence and upper tail independence between oil and non-ferrous metals markets. The lower temporal dependence is positive and heterogeneous between oil and non-ferrous markets and intensified during the onset of the global financial crisis (GFC) for copper, lead, and tin markets. The upside and downside spillovers from oil to non-ferrous markets and vice versa is significant and increased during times of GFC, oil price crash, and COVID-19 outbreak. The highest spillover effects are observed for the aluminum market, which is very vulnerable to oil price instabilities. Moreover, the spillover effects are asymmetric for all markets. Finally, we find that the CDB for aluminum and nickel are quite similar, and for lead, tin and zinc are also closed the same. The CDB is higher for nickel regardless of the portfolio composition and the probability level. The diversification gains decrease during stress market periods. Our findings have important implications in terms of funds allocation and portfolio design.",

            "abstract": "This paper examines co-movements, risk spillovers, and portfolio implications between precious metals (gold, platinum, and silver) and main energy (crude oil, natural gas, gasoline, and gas oil) futures price returns. We use the spillover index, different wavelet approaches, and different diversification tools. The results show dynamic volatility among markets that are intensified during financial and oil crises. Gold and oil are a net contributor to volatility whereas the remaining markets are a net receiver of risk irrespective of the market status. Moreover, we find insignificant (weak) co-movements between energy and precious metals at high (medium and low) frequency. The global financial crisis followed by the great oil price bust in 2014 intensifies return co-movements at low frequency. The results of the multivariate wavelet approach reveal that gas oil, natural gas, and gasoline intensify co-movements between crude oil and precious metals. The results of our research are of interest to investors, fund managers, and policy-makers having practical applications for better decision-making.",

We use the time-frequency domain spillover index methodology of Barun\u00c3\u00adk and K\u00c5\u0099ehl\u00c3\u00adk (2018). The results show that the UK stock market is the largest contributor to and receipt of short-term spillovers. Gold, palladium, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Bulgarian, Mexican, and Russian stock markets are the next receivers of spillover. German and Australian stock markets are, respectively, the largest source and receipt of spillovers in the long term. Furthermore, the spillovers in the short term are higher than their counterparts in the long term, and they are more pronounced during the global financial crisis (GFC). Precious metals contribute more to the forecasting variance for stock markets in the top precious metal exporter economies than in the top precious metal importer economies. They receive more spillovers from stock markets in the top precious metal exporters irrespective of time horizons. In addition, the spillover effects in the short term are higher than their counterparts in the long term in top precious metal exporters. Precious metals provide a better hedging effectiveness than individual equity portfolios. Finally, the hedging effectiveness is higher in the short term relative to the long term for stock markets of precious metal-exporter economies.",

Various copula functions along with the Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) technique and the Conditional Value at Risk (CoVaR) measure are used. The results show evidence of a negative and positive average dependence between energy (crude oil, natural gas, and gasoline) and almost all MENA stock markets before and after the oil crash in the short term. In the long term, we find a significant average dependence before the crash and an upper tail dependence after the crash between crude oil and almost all the MENA stock markets. Natural gas exhibits a positive and upper tail dependence with almost all MENA markets before the crash and an average dependence after the crash. For gasoline, the results however are mixed for the average and tail dependence before and after the crash. Furthermore, the dependence is higher in the long than the short term and after the oil crash than before it. The VaR and CoVaR values show that the expected loss of portfolios is more significant after the crash and in the long term. Finally, the stock markets of the oil-exporting MENA countries are more affected by the energy price shocks than the oil-importing MENA countries as reflected in the intensification of the dependence level and the systemic risk results.",

The results show zero tail dependence between oil and stock returns at the short term. In contrast, we find a lower tail independence and an upper tail dependence at the long term. Our results highlight that oil futures serve as hedge assets at short term and a safe haven asset at the long term. Furthermore, we find significant and asymmetric risk spillovers from oil to ASEAN markets. The downside and upside spillovers are higher at the long term than short term and increase during the GFC, the recent oil crisis, and COVID-19 periods. Finally, we show that an equally weighted portfolio provides highest diversification benefits at both lower and medium tail distributions with the exception of Malaysian market. The diversification benefits of oil are sizeable for less coupling markets and fall during times of GFC and oil crisis.",

            "abstract": "This paper examines quantile return spillovers and the connectedness between crude oil futures and key precious metals (PMs) using the approach developed by Ando et al. (2022). Our findings show that using the cross-quantilogram directional spillover method results in significant spillovers from oil to PMs under an extreme downside oil market scenario. Oil impacts both palladium and platinum under an extreme upside oil market status. Under normal oil market conditions, we show insignificant spillovers from oil to PMs. We find an insignificant dependence of PMs on oil during bearish markets, indicating that PMs serve as a safe haven asset. However, we find that oil and palladium are net receivers of spillovers across quantiles, except for palladium at intermediate quantiles, and other PMs are net contributors of spillovers across all quantiles. The spillovers are higher at extreme quantiles and increase during extreme events. Furthermore, we find no connection between platinum and gold under normal market conditions and a weak connection between platinum and both silver and palladium during bearish market scenarios. Precious metals are good diversifying assets for oil portfolios. The hedging strategy using PMs is less expensive during the COVID-19 pandemic than before it, with the exception of platinum. Finally, PMs offer higher hedging effectiveness before the pandemic crisis, whereas palladium provides the highest hedging effectiveness before and during the pandemic crisis.",

We apply the spillover index by Diebold and Yilmaz (2012) and wavelet methods. The results show significant risk spillovers among the leading energy futures markets. Moreover, the spillovers are intensified during the financial crisis, oil crisis and COVID-19 outbreak. WTI crude oil is the highest net contributor of volatility spillovers to the other markets, whereas the other energy markets are net receivers of spillovers for the different sub periods, with the exception of natural gas before the GFC and during COVID-19 as well as Brent oil during COVID-19. Furthermore, the results show significant integration and multiscale co-movements among energy futures. Natural gas asset offers better diversification benefits to crude oil, heating oil, gasoline and gas oil under short term. Finally, the diversification gains diminish as scales rise. The optimal weight, hedge ratios and hedging effectiveness are time varying and crises-sensitive.

The results show co-movements between oil price and stock market returns at the lower scale or in the long-term. Coherence between oil and stock markets reaches maximal levels during the period of the 2008 financial crisis and the ensuing slow economic recovery from 2009. The strong co-movements between crude oil price returns and BRICS stock market returns take place after the removal of the effects of natural gas price returns. Multivariate coherency shows strong contributions of stock market returns and natural gas price returns to crude oil price returns. Given the less co-movements between natural gas and stock markets, natural gas provides higher diversification benefits. The risk is highest in the short-run compared to the medium-and long-term.",
