            "title": "Underpricing on the Selected European Alternative Investment Markets",
            "abstract": "The phenomenon of underpricing is the subject of many studies on the stock markets, but there is still a research gap referring to the European Alternative Investment Markets, markets for small and medium companies. They are a source of capital and such an anomaly as underpricing could be a barrier for development of young companies. It means so-called money left on the table, which constrain the effectiveness of the market. The purpose of the paper is to analyze whether lower entry regulations on the European Alternative Investment Markets are correlated with the higher value of underpricing as the demonstration of higher investing risk. We calculate raw initial returns with different equilibrium prices for three European Alternative Investment Markets and confirm that NewConnect, the market with the lighter legal environment, has the highest initial returns for the first day of trading, however after one month returns turn out to be significantly lower than on the other two markets and differs for aftermarket rate of returns. Our results suggest that there is a premium for higher risk on NewConnect, but only after one month rate of returns turn out to be negative, which can suggest that market participants verify very quickly the quality of issuers.",

            "abstract": "In this paper, we provide a cross-industry perspective on the market reaction to different corporate news in the context of Indian stock market. We have studied the price and volume movements associated with eight broadly defined news categories namely Analyst Calls, Earnings, Earnings Forecasts, Finance, Legal and Regulatory, Management, Operations and Restructuring. We have employed the standard event study methodology on a sample of stocks listed on the National Stock Exchange of India for the purpose of our study. We observe that the market reaction to firm specific corporate news varies according to the type of news across different industry groups. We also observe that the sentiment of the news is a critical factor which influences the market reaction to such news flow across industry groups. We also provide a cross-industry perspective on the relative importance of different corporate news categories after taking into account the sentiment of the news in the context of Indian stock market.",

            "title": "Systematic Mispricing in European Equity Prices?",
            "abstract": "One empirical argument that has been around for some time and that clearly contra- dicts equity market efficiency is that market prices seem too volatile to be optimal estimates of the present value of future discounted cash flows. Based on this, it is deduced that systematic pricing errors occur in equity markets which hence can not be efficient in the Effcient Market Hypothesis sense. The paper tries to show that this so-called excess volatility is to a large extend the result of the underlying assumptions, which are being employed to estimate the present value of cash flows. Using monthly data for three investment style indices from an integrated European Equity market, all usual assumptions are dropped. This is achieved by employing the Gordon Growth Model and using an estimation process for the dividend growth rate that was suggested by Barsky and De Long. In extension to Barsky and De Long, the discount rate is not assumed at some arbitrary level, but it is estimated from the data. In this manner, the empirical results do not rely on the prerequisites of sta- tionary dividends, constant dividend growth rates as well as non-variable discount rates. It is shown that indeed volatility declines considerably, but is not eliminated. Furthermore, it can be seen that the resulting discount factors for the three in- vestment style indices can not be considered equal, which, on a risk-adjusted basis, indicates performance differences in the investment strategies and hence stands in contradiction to an efficient market. Finally, the estimated discount rates under- went a plausibility check, by comparing their general movement to a market based interest rate. Besides the most recent data, the estimated discount rates match the movements of market interest rates fairly well.",

            "abstract": "This paper provides international evidence for the presence of the day of the week effects in stock market returns denominated in both local currencies and the US dollars in most of the nineteen countries in the sample for the period July 1993 to July 1998. The observed daily patterns differ for local and dollar returns, the latter being exhibiting lower daily means and higher standard deviations. In local currency terms, a pattern of higher returns around the middle of the week, Tuesday and then Wednesday; and a lower pattern towards the end of the week, Thursday and then Friday, are observed. In dollar terms, a higher pattern occurs around the middle of the week, Wednesday and then Tuesday; and a lower one is observed towards the end of the week, Thursday and then Friday. The lower patterns are more apparent in both cases. Volatility is the highest on Mondays in both local and dollar returns. Local returns have the lowest volatility towards the end of the week, Thursday and Friday, whereas the lowest volatility of dollar returns are observed on Tuesdays. The results have useful implications for international portfolio diversification.",

            "title": "Excess Volatility in European Equity Style Indices - New Evidence",
            "abstract": "Are financial markets efficient? One proposition that seems to contradict this is Shiller's finding of excess volatility in asset prices and its resulting rejection of the discounted cash flow model. This paper replicates Shiller's approach for a different data set and extends his analysis by testing for a long-run relationship by means of a cointegration analysis. Contrary to previous studies, monthly data for an integrated European stock market is being used, with special attention to equity style investment strategies. On the basis of this analysis' results, Shiller's findings seem questionable. While a long-run relationship between prices and dividends can be observed for all equity styles, a certain degree, but to a much smaller extent than in Shiller's approach, of excess volatility cannot be rejected. But it seems that a further relaxation of Shiller's assumptions would completely eliminate the finding of an overly strong reaction of prices to changes in dividends. Two interesting side results are, that all three investment styles seem to have equal performance when adjusting for risk, which by itself is an indication for efficiency and that market participants seem to use current dividend payments from one company as an indication for future dividend payments by other firms. Overall the results of this paper lead to the conclusion that efficiency cannot be rejected for an integrated European equity market.",

            "abstract": "The aim of this study is to provide a comprehensive description of the dependence pattern of stock returns by studying a range of quantiles of the conditional return distribution using quantile autoregression. This enables us in particular to study the behavior of extreme quantiles associated with large positive and negative returns in contrast to the central quantile which is closely related to the conditional mean in the least-squares regression framework. Our empirical results are based on 30 years of daily, weekly and monthly returns of the stocks comprised in the Dow Jones Stoxx 600 index. We find that lower quantiles exhibit positive dependence on past returns while upper quantiles are marked by negative dependence. This pattern holds when accounting for stock specific characteristics such as market capitalization, industry, or exposure to market risk.",

            "abstract": "We examine large price changes, known as jumps, in the U.S. Treasury market. Using recently developed statistical tools, we identify price jumps in the 2-, 3-, 5-, 10-year notes and 30-year bond during the period of 2005-2006. Our results show that jumps mostly occur during prescheduled macroeconomic announcements or events. Nevertheless, market surprise based on preannouncement surveys is an imperfect predictor of bond price jumps. We find that a macroeconomic news announcement is often preceeded by an increase in market volatility and a withdrawal of liquidity, and that liquidity shocks play an important role for price jumps in U.S. Treasury market. More importantly, we present evidence that jumps serve as a dramatic form of price discovery in the sense that they help to quickly incorporate market information into bond prices.",

The analysis suggests two important findings. First, foreign investors do not consider the market portfolio of domestic securities as predicted by standard theories of international portfolio diversification. Second, the firm's size and the expected return are central to explain foreign investors' equity trades. The results are consistent with models based upon the hypothesis of differential information between foreign and domestic investors.",

            "abstract": "Existing studies show that U.S. Treasury bond price changes are mainly driven by public information shocks, as manifested in macroeconomic news announcements and events. The literature also shows that heterogeneous private information contributes significantly to price discovery for U.S. Treasury securities. In this paper, we use high frequency transaction data for 2-, 5-, and 10-year Treasury notes and employ a Markov switching model to identify intraday private information flow in the U.S. Treasury market. We show that the probability of private information flow (PPIF) identified in our model effectively captures permanent price effects in U.S. Treasury securities. In addition, our results show that public information shocks and heterogeneous private information are the main factors of bond price discovery on announcement days, whereas private information and liquidity shocks play more important roles in bond price variation on non-announcement days. Most interestingly, our results show that the role of heterogeneous private information is more prominent when public information shocks are either high or low. Furthermore, we show that heterogeneous private information flow is followed by low trading volume, low total market depth and hidden depth. The pattern is more pronounced on non-announcement days.",

We find that investor heterogeneity provides a possible explanation for the decreased market efficiency before scheduled news announcements.",
