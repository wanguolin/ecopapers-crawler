            "abstract": "This paper explores commonalities across asset pricing anomalies. In particular, we assess implications of financial distress for the profitability of anomaly-based trading strategies. Strategies based on price momentum, earnings momentum, credit risk, dispersion, idiosyncratic volatility, and capital investments derive their profitability from taking short positions in high credit risk firms that experience deteriorating credit conditions. In contrast, the value-based strategy derives most of its profitability from taking long positions in high credit risk firms that survive financial distress and subsequently realize high returns. The accruals anomaly is an exception. It is robust among high and low credit risk firms in all credit conditions.",

            "abstract": "Abstract This paper analyzes market reactions to the 2013\u00e2\u0080\u00932014 Fed announcements related to the tapering of asset purchases and examines how these reactions are influenced by financial depth. The study focuses on long-term government bond yields and uses daily data for all emerging markets. Controlling for all time-invariant country characteristics as well as time-varying macroeconomic fundamentals (changes in current account, fiscal balance, GDP growth, and inflation), countries with deeper domestic financial markets (as measured by higher bank credit, M2, M3, or stock market capitalization) experienced smaller increases in government bond yields during 4-day windows around Federal Open Market Committee announcements related to tapering. Countries with better macroeconomic fundamentals (measured by improvements in current account, fiscal balance, and GDP growth) also experienced smaller increases in government bond yields around such episodes.",

A large proportion of the total equity premium is realized on days with macroeconomic announcements. The relation between market betas and expected returns is far stronger on announcement days as compared with nonannouncement days. Finally, these results hold for fixed-income investments as well as for stocks. We present a model in which agents learn the probability of an adverse economic state on announcement days.

            "abstract": "This paper studies market efficiency from weak form aspect using data of Shanghai Stock Exchange composite index (SSEC) and Shenzhen Stock Exchange composite index (SZSEC) under expected return theory. Some classical methods are used to examine the features of stock returns and a little evidence against mutually independency, random walk of returns, and sub-martingale of stock prices is found. A notion of a new simple statistical test based on information set for judgement of market efficiency is proposed. Through hypothesis tests, evidence indicating inefficient markets around 2008, 2011 and 2018 under expected return theory is found. It is a new finding that SZSEC is more sensitive to information and therefore may be more appealing to investors than SSEC. Moreover, there is an another new finding that when market extends in size the degree of whole market efficiency declines. From the relationship between market efficiency and volatility, volatility is not a very good criterion for market efficiency but some rough rules can be concluded to help investors make their decisions on what time to conduct their own strategies. Finally, the results suggest that it is the time to think about strategies.",

            "abstract": "The paper incorporates a partial asymmetric price adjustment model for individual investors action into an EGARCH model, clarifies the relationship between the price adjustment speed, the market efficiency and asymmetric price adjustment, and measures over (under)-evaluation of stock value. The stock price does not fully adjust to the market value of stocks hoped by investors and does not adjust symmetrically in upturn and downturn, if and only if the market is not efficient, and moreover the market value generally diverts from the fundamental value of stocks even though the market is efficient. As an operational example, the Tokyo stock market is found to be inefficient during 1980-2005. The speed of price adjustment is asymmetric in the 80s but symmetric in the 90s and 2000s. The over-evaluation of the market value is remarkably observed in the 80s but not in the 90s and 2000s.",

It also examines the stochastic dynamics of the implied volatility index and its relationship with realized volatility in both markets. There is evidence that implied volatility is governed by a long-memory process. Despite its upward bias, implied volatility is more reflective of changes in realized volatility than alternative GARCH models, which account for volatility persistence and the asymmetric impact of news. The implied volatility index is also found to be inclusive of some but not all information on future volatility contained in historical returns. However, its higher out-of sample performance provides further support to the rationale behind drawing inference about future stock market volatility based on the incremental information contained in options prices.",
