            "abstract": "Abstract We propose a simple agent-based version of Paul de Grauwe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chaotic exchange rate model. In particular, we assume that each speculator follows his own technical and fundamental trading rule. Moreover, a speculator\u00e2\u0080\u0099s choice between these two trading philosophies depends on his individual assessment of current market circumstances. Our agent-based model setup is able to explain a number of important stylized facts of foreign exchange markets, including bubbles and crashes, excess volatility, fat-tailed return distributions, serially uncorrelated returns and volatility clustering. A stability and bifurcation analysis of its deterministic skeleton provides us with useful insights that foster our understanding of exchange rate dynamics.",

            "abstract": "This paper explores the impact of different crises on the informational efficiency of financial assets. The study covers stock markets indices (ASX200, DAX30, EuroStoxx50, S&P500 and Nikkei), commodities (gold and oil) and volatility (VIX). The study analyzes, using a rolling window method, the long memory profile and the multifractality of the time series by means of the DFA and generalized Hurst exponents. This dynamic analysis is important as it uncovers the time-varying behavior of returns characteristics, affecting the investment decisions and trading strategies at different moments of time. The paper extends the current literature on informational efficiency, providing evidence of the distinct impact on the long memory and on the multifractality of the time series, depending on the nature of the crisis and the market. The results could be of interest for investors as well as for academics, regarding the hedging limits of the models during calm or turbulent times.",

The results indicate that returns on cryptocurrencies increase significantly during Chinese holiday periods. Additionally, we use textual analysis to construct an investor sentiment indicator and find that positive investor sentiment boosts cryptocurrency market returns. However, when positive investor sentiment prevails in the cryptocurrency market, the holiday effect weakens, implying that positive investor sentiment attenuates the holiday effect. Robustness tests based on the Bitcoin market generate consistent results. Moreover, this study explores the mechanisms underlying the cryptocurrency holiday effect and examines the impact of epidemic transmission risk and heterogeneity characteristics on this phenomenon. These findings offer novel insights into the impact of Chinese statutory holidays on the cryptocurrency market and illuminate the role of investor sentiment in this market.",

            "abstract": "Abstract We examine technology ETF and uncertainty index (VIX, GVZ, and OVZ) spillover dynamics and quantile frequency interconnectedness across market states. This study is the first to use quantile-frequency spillover, quadruple wavelet coherence, and wavelet quantile correlation methodologies to facilitate these analyses. The total connectedness index value is 70%, which is much higher in both the upper and lower quantiles. Under normal market conditions, short-term connectedness significantly exceeds long-term connectedness. Levels of ETF-uncertainty indicator connectedness increase under extreme market conditions; most technology ETFs are net spillover transmitters and uncertainty indices net spillover receivers, indicating the contagion risk of ETF investments. We show that while greater ETF-uncertainty index connectedness may benefit portfolio diversification, large fluctuations in technology EFTs can result in financial instability due to high market volatility. In the long term, the joint effects of uncertainty indices on ETFs are significant, with negative correlations between ETFs and uncertainties at different frequencies, supporting the potential role of uncertainty indices in hedging technology ETF portfolio risks. Dynamic portfolio rebalancing, scenario analysis, and stress testing may help to manage the effects of high connectedness.",

The model introduces a common leverage factor derived through principal component regression, replacing the traditional individual leverage factor.

Our results show that the P-LHAR model outperforms the traditional HAR, LHAR and combination models, especially in turbulent periods, on weekly and monthly horizons. In-sample estimates indicate the relevance of the common leverage factor, which further strengthened by the superior out-of-sample predictive performance across various horizons.

This correlation shapes the temporal properties of a perfect Bayesian equilibrium. The more positive the correlation coefficient, the faster prices incorporate private information. In contrast, when the correlation is negative and only one risk-neutral insider exists, an abundant amount of private information cannot be revealed after the final trade, and market liquidity deteriorates over time. Moreover, information is revealed faster during earlier periods if positively correlated noise demand is concentrated early, whereas more information remains hidden after the final trade if negatively correlated noise demand is concentrated later. The inefficiency caused by negatively correlated noise demand can be resolved if insiders are competitive or risk averse.",

            "abstract": "The possibility of random walk movements in the log-returns of exchange rate series as well as the characterization of returns by periods of tranquility and volatility is of interest in financial time series modelling. These features make the analysis of exchange rates to be important in the design of policy, portfolio and risk management whenever international trade and finance is discussed. This paper investigated the level of exchange rates market efficiency and volatility at three market phases of US Dollar-South African Rands and US Dollars-British Pounds exchange rates for the daily periods from 2 January 1995 to 8 June 2016. This paper applied the modified Hurst exponent' and volatility modelling techniques on the series log-returns, absolute and squared log-returns used as proxies to volatility. The results of the modified Hurst exponent techniques on the log-returns and squared log-returns show that the future path of the exchange rates returns in these markets are not governed by their immediate past in the second and third identified phases. Thus, the two markets have been in the state of weak form of efficiency since 2001 to the current transition, with UK exchange rate market more efficient than South African exchange rate market. Using the efficiency and volatility indices to classify the two exchange rate markets as well as the market phases, we observe similar transition in the level of market efficiency in these markets, this which is as a result of trade partnership between the two countries. In terms of market volatility, we cannot make a clearer judgement between the two economies. This paper has repositioned the stability foreign exchange rates of South Africa, a member of Group of 20 (G20) countries, with that of a member of the G7 countries, that is, the UK. To the government, risk and portfolio managers, the findings emanating from this paper indicated that the South Africa's Rand is also stable like the British Pound, and thus, can be traded on the international currency market without fear of excessive loss/gain.",

This is motivated by the Lucas island model which suggests an inverse relationship between the effectiveness of a policy and the level of uncertainty in the economy. Using high frequency daily data from the Federal funds futures market, we first estimate the response of S&P 500 stock returns to monetary policy surprises within the time varying parameter (TVP) model. We then analyze the relationship of these time varying estimates with the benchmark VIX index and alternative measures of uncertainty. Evidence suggests a significant negative relationship between the level of uncertainty and the time varying response of S&P 500 stock returns to unanticipated changes in the interest rate. Thus, at higher levels of uncertainty the impact of monetary policy shocks on stock markets is lower. The results are robust to different measures of uncertainty.",

            "abstract": "Abstract This paper examines the effects of dark and lit market fragmentation around both earnings announcements and earnings surprises. Results indicate that both dark and lit market fragmentation increase around earnings announcements. Further, I test whether dark and lit fragmentation hinder the level of price discovery around the earnings announcement, resulting in greater post-earnings announcement drift, PEAD. The analysis reveals that lit fragmentation has no significant impact on PEAD while dark fragmentation reduces the level of PEAD for stocks with positive earnings surprises. This result is consistent with the notion that dark venues capture more uninformed trading around positive news events, resulting in greater informed trading and higher informational efficiency in the lit venue. However, the results also indicate that dark fragmentation leads to stronger PEAD for stocks with negative earnings surprises. This last finding suggests that informed traders migrate to dark venues around negative earnings surprises, consistent with previous research that argues informed traders follow passive trading strategies around negative news events.",
