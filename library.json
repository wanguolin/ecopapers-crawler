        "abstract": "January returns on stock markets can be used as a barometer for the subsequent 11-month holding period returns as documented by Cooper et al. (2006). We examine this apparent anomaly and analyze the effects of other holding periods of 1, 3, and 6 months in six Central and Eastern European transition economies from January 1991 through December 2013. Our results do not support the presence of the other January effect (OJE) in five of the six markets. Instead, the results reveal significant anomalies in non-January months and that such effects vary across markets. This latter evidence might reflect different characteristics in these economies, including diverse levels of market efficiency, local risk factors, and portfolio management among others. Furthermore, we construct a trading rule using the other month effect to illustrate the possibility of developing profitable investment strategies to earn abnormal returns.",

Second, we noticed at least four types of patterns in the term structure reaction of interest rates across maturities, including the humpshaped one that is generally considered. Third, we propose a first interpretation and classification of these different shapes. Fourth we find that the existence of outliers in interest rates leads to an underestimation of the reaction of interest rates to announcements, explaining the different results obtained between high-frequency and daily datasets.",

The results show that on mid-term and long-term scales, the dependence relationships between the oil and green stock markets are tighter while lead-lag patterns are mixed and time-varying. Total risk spillovers between the oil and green stock markets are mostly conveyed over time. Risk spillovers from the oil market are substantially larger in the green stock market. Furthermore, global crises such as the Great Recession, the oil price collapse, and the COVID-19 pandemic have substantially amplified the magnitude of risk spillovers. Overall, the green stock market has not yet developed enough potential for a larger independence from the conventional energy market. Hence, for participants in the energy and financial markets who have different time horizons for asset allocation and risk management and for committed investors in particular, the examination of time-frequency dependence and risk spillovers can be quite beneficial.",

Additionally, we quantify the cumulative return of the investment portfolio, optimal weights, time-varying risk coverage, and hedging effectiveness of bivariate commodity portfolios using the Minimum Variance Portfolio (MVP), Minimum Correlation Portfolio (MCP), Minimum Connectedness Portfolio (MCoP) under bearish, tranquil, and bullish market conditions. The results show that maize and natural gas are the main net receivers of spillovers, whereas wheat and Brent oil are the main net transmitters of shocks to the network, respectively. Our findings of optimal weights in multivariate portfolio suggest more weights for agri-commodities against fossil fuels in all three modes of market. In addition, the optimal weights of bivariate portfolio analysis show that the most optimal portfolio which has the highest HE value is related to natural gas pairs with agri-commodities. Moreover, depending on the status of the market; in an average and bearish modes, the highest optimal weight is related to maize/natural gas. However, in the bullish market, the highest optimal weights are related to natural gas/Brent oil pair. Furthermore, the results of optimal bivariate hedge ratios show that natural gas/wheat (wheat/maize and vice versa) portfolio is the cheapest (the most expensive) investment strategy in all modes of market and based on MVP and MCoP approaches.",

Moreover, the extent of dependence is higher at the long term than at the short- and medium-terms, irrespective of time horizons. Gold and silver show negative and positive short-term dependence during bearish and bull market conditions, respectively, at two-day trading. The dependence switches to positive beyond two trading days. We find asymmetric dependence between crude oil and energy sector uncertainty indexes at two-day trading. The dependence is positive at medium and long terms. Furthermore, the magnitude of dependence between metal (gold, gold mining and silver) and energy uncertainty indexes (crude oil and energy sectors) is sensitive to market conditions.",

The results show the symmetric dependence between currencies and precious metals before the COVID-19 crisis. In contrast, we show negative and positive tail asymmetric dependences during the pandemic crisis. The COVID-19 crisis significantly amplifies the magnitude of spillover effects among the studied markets where the AUD currency exhibits the largest transmission and reception of downside and upside spillover to/from most precious metals before and during the pandemic crisis.

Besides, the results reveal that the co-movement is intensified during global financial crisis and COVID-19 pandemic periods, confirming recoupling hypothesis. The risk analysis reveals dependence and persistence of co-movements, and aggravation of portfolio risk in the BRICS economies and across markets during bouts of afflictions.

This study examines the earnings announcement premium with a focus on the relationship between stock returns and return volatilities. Our findings can be summarized as follows. First, based on the long-term data including the post financial crisis period, we find that the earnings announcement premium still exists, positive and significant. Second, the announcement premium is positively related to the expected volatility. The positive relationship between the announcement premium and the expected volatility indicates a risk-return tradeoff, suggesting that investors hold on to their stocks expecting that their taking risk is compensated with returns. Third, we find that the announcement premium is inversely related to the realized volatility. The negative relationship is not confined to the group of negative earnings surprises. These results suggest that a dynamic of inverse relationship between returns and volatilities coexists with a risk-return tradeoff around earnings announcements. Extending our study to Asian-Pacific stock market might shed lights on commonalities and differences in international risk-return tradeoff.",

Similarly, Sukuk is affected by its own shocks, and the magnitude of the spillover increases in a high-volatility regime. Sukuk has an insignificant impact on Islamic stocks in Regime 1 and the effect becomes significant in Regime 2. Moreover, the likelihood of transition is more persistent in Regime 1 than in Regime 2. In addition, the shifts from one regime to another are more persistent than those in the opposite sense. Furthermore, the World Islamic stock markets are the net contributors of spillover to Sukuk for all regimes, and their capacity for spillover increases in Regime 2, whereas Sukuk is the net receiver of spillover for both regimes. In contrast, the ability of the European and Asian Islamic markets as net contributors decreases in Regime 2, and the contribution of Sukuk spillovers increases.

We find that the abnormal return is between 80% and 90% due to involuntary delisting in the Korean market, where liquidity all but disappears as a result of delisting. Prior to delisting, however, domestic individual investors are net buyers of delisted firms while both domestic institutional investors and foreign investors are net sellers. On the other hand, the share ownership of large shareholders, on average, declines by more than 30% over the course of two years prior to involuntary delisting. Using delisting probability model, we find that the change in the share ownership of large shareholders is a significant predictor of delisting while that of domestic institutional investors and foreign investors is not. Our findings suggest that large shareholders reduce their share ownership in anticipation of delisting and that there is a wealth transfer from individual investors to large shareholders surrounding involuntary delisting in markets where the separation between ownership and control is weak and the participation of retail investors is large.",

However, since data asset disclosure can also be engaged in impression management by firms, its contribution to market efficiency may be impeded. Using a sample of Chinese A-share listed firms from 2014 to 2020, this study examines the impact of increased data asset information disclosure on the subsequent stock price volatility. The findings suggest that more data asset disclosure reduces stock return idiosyncratic volatility. The mechanism analysis shows that data asset disclosure reduces idiosyncratic volatility of stock prices by mitigating analyst forecast dispersion and noise trading induced by buy-sell imbalances. Moreover, this mitigating effect is more pronounced in firms with more analyst following, observable digital investments, and higher liquidity. But the effect is diminished if firms use a more positive abnormal tone in their annual reports.",

        "abstract": "The main objective of this paper is to investigate the influence of price limits on the overreaction hypothesis in the Egyptian Stock Exchange (EGX) during the period 1999\u00e2\u0080\u00932010. I find evidence of the overreaction anomaly in the EGX within different price limit regimes. Price reversal is observed two and three days post lower and upper limit hits respectively within the strict price limits regime. However, it occurs after one day only for both lower and upper limit hits within the circuit breakers regime. These results support the directional effect hypothesis as large stock price movements are followed by price reversals in the opposite direction. Moreover, the results support the magnitude effect hypothesis as the larger the initial price movements the greater the subsequent reversals.",

Design/Approach/Methodology: By using statistical models and lag time variables (one year lag) to interpret the return on investment per share in the current year, it is concluded that there was no statistically significant effect of the following independent factors: capital adequacy, surpluses, cash, market value-added, liquidity ratio, and trading volume on return on investment for commercial bank shares. Findings: The study showed a statistically significant effect of the size of the assets and the tax rate on the return on investment of commercial banks' shares. Moreover, the independent factors explain 55% of the fluctuations that occur in the profitability of banks. Practical Implication: The study recommends paying attention to intellectual capital (added market value). It was not statistically significant and important as a factor that reflects the extent of banking awareness among clients and the extent of their acceptance of banks' new banking services.

The research is dedicated to the fourteen main stocks on the Prague Stock Exchange. The investigated period was November 2012 - December 2018. The research applies a test for identifying significant price-related information, a so-called swap variance test. We analyse a price response to such information shocks. The results include both positive and negative shocks, where the positive ones are more frequent. A further exploration confirmed the existence of short-term and mid-term underreaction in the case of positive news and short term underreaction in the case of negative news. The evidence of abnormal returns identified the presence of an information inefficiency on the investigated market. The inefficiency related to negative information shocks arrives much earlier, but also lasts only for a couple of days. On the other hand, our results show that positive information shocks are more pervasive according to a portfolio holding period. We deduct from the results that investors perceive losses and gains differently and thus behave differently following the unexpected stock related news. In overall, the investors act more precise when the stock price tumbles.",

        "abstract": "According to financial theory, in an efficient market investors reflect fully and instantaneously all relevant information on security prices in a way consistent with the economic theory. Empirical research on market efficiency investigates if there is past available information which can help to predict future returns profitably, as well as if factors not related to rational economic behaviour, influence stock prices. Financial manias and panics are examples which serve as obvious evidence against the efficient market theory. This study investigates the stock price behaviour of a number of listed banks prior and during the financial crisis of 2008-2009. Banks under investigation were separated into two categories i.e. large banks and small banks. These two categories behaved differently under the crisis. We have serious reasons to believe that the different behaviour was not due to different performance or risk exposure but due to different ownership structure. Big banks, with high institutional participation indicated stock price dynamics during the crisis, possibly because of the fact that institutional investors were affected by correlated negative sentiment or mimicking minimising loss strategies irrespectively of the quality of the banks\u00e2\u0080\u0099 assets. Thus, the ownership structure of an asset may be of importance to its stock price behaviour contrary to the prediction of the efficient market theory.",

The magnitudes of reversals and continuations are also greater for smaller firms and firms with lower institutional ownership.

We find that foreign institutional investors are the most informed traders, with their predictive ability being more apparent in a downward market.

The predictive ability of foreign institutional investors is found to be significantly enhanced on days with important macroeconomic news, thereby indicating their superior interpretative ability of publicly accessible information.

We use the methodologies developed by Diebold and Yilmaz (2012) and Barun\u00c3\u00adk and K\u00c5\u0099ehl\u00c3\u00adk (2018) and the in-sample VaR performance to achieve our objectives. The results show that the spillover effect between the oil and the considered stock markets is time-varying, crisis-sensitive, and frequency-dependent. In addition, this effect had intensified during the onset of the 2008\u00e2\u0080\u00932009 Global Financial Crisis, the plunge of oil prices that started in the mid-2014, and the occurrence of COVID-19. Furthermore, the results also demonstrate that oil is a net receiver of risk in the system, irrespective of the time horizon. Among the GIPSI markets, the larger and highly indebted EU economies of Italy and Spain are net contributors of risk, while the smaller EU economies of Greece, Ireland, and Portugal as well as Asia are net receivers of risk, also regardless of the time horizons. The US and European stock markets are net contributors of the spillovers, whereas the Asia equity index is a net receiver, irrespective of the frequencies. Finally, the AR(1)-FIGARCH model with the skewed Student-t distribution provides more accurate in-sample estimates in all markets. The hedging is more expensive in the long term than in the short term. The hedging is also more expensive during the ESDC period than the other turbulent periods considered in the study. The hedging effectiveness is also higher in the long term than in the short term, is crisis-sensitive, and depends on the time-investment horizon factor.",

Overall, our evidence highlights the important role of the pre-opening period in price discovery and the prospect of further enhancing this role by timing the release of public information to occur during non-trading hours.",

        "abstract": "The objective of our investigation is to test empirically the existence of the day of the week effect on the Canadian stock market between September 2009 and August 2019. Our findings show that the day of the week effect is present. The highest and lowest mean daily returns of the S&P/TSX Composite index are detected on Tuesday and Monday, respectively. Moreover, we try to give an explanation of the day of the week effect by referring to the world market risk. Using unconditional and conditional models, our results reveal that only the significant Monday effect is still present after accounting for world market risk. Then, we can deduce that the Monday effect in returns of the S&P/TSX Composite index is not explained by the risk-return relationship and that it is an anomaly of the Canadian stock market.",

        "abstract": "A large class of fixed income trading strategies focuses on opportunities offered by the interest rate term structure. This paper studies a set of yield curve trading strategies that are based on the view that the yield curve mean-reverts to an unconditional curve. These mean-reverting trading strategies exploit deviations in the level, slope and curvature of the yield curve from historical norms. We consider cash-neutral trades with one-month holding periods. Some mean-reverting strategies were found to be highly profitable, and outperform, on a risk-adjusted basis before transaction costs, alternative strategies of an investment in the Lehman Brothers Bond index (by up to 5.9 times) and an investment in the S&P index (by up to 5.1 times). Even after accounting for transaction costs, some of these strategies are still significantly more profitable than the benchmarks. Furthermore, transaction costs can be reduced substantially by changing the trading frequency or through structured derivative trades. We found evidence that market efficiency has improved, and the scope for excess returns has diminished since the late 1980s",

The sample consists of 292 IPOs listed on Bursa Malaysia between May 2003 and December 2012. IPO lockup in Malaysia is mandatory as opposed to voluntary where it is negotiated between firms and underwriters. Using the market model event study method, the result shows a significant negative abnormal return at the expiration of the lockup period. Thus, the study provides evidence that contradicts the semi-strong form of the efficient market hypothesis (EMH). According to EMH, the expiration of the lockup period which is public knowledge should not be accompanied with a significant abnormal return. In addition, the study also shows the existence of higher abnormal trading volume at lockup expiration.",

Using the market reaction in the three-day period surrounding the announcements of extreme earnings surprises (i.e., SUE) in quarter Qt as a reference point, we show that firms reporting a high (low) SUE in subsequent quarter Qt+1 that confirms their initial quarter Qt SUE ranking in the same highest or lowest SUE quintiles generate an incremental price run that moves in the same direction as that of the initial SUE. However, the price impact of the confirming SUE signal is weaker than that of its initial SUE. Our findings are robust to the Fama-French three-factor daily regression extended by the momentum factor and a number of other robustness tests. Our result is not consistent with the prevalent view that investors underreact to earnings news. To the contrary, the evidence suggests an initial investor overreaction to extreme SUE signals.",

This manipulation, which made use of specific features of the market microstructure, differs from previously studied forms of manipulation based on information or transactions. Roughly half of the spoofing orders were placed in conjunction with day trading. Stocks targeted for manipulation had higher return volatility, lower market capitalization, lower price level, and lower managerial transparency.

Approximately one-quarter of new information is reflected in options prices before being transmitted to stock prices, with options playing a more important role in price discovery around information events. Using unique data on traders prosecuted for insider trading, we find that they often choose to trade in options, attracted by their leverage, and when they do the options share of price discovery is higher. Our results help interpret conflicting findings in the existing literature.",

We directly test these models using an experimental setting where waiting time is important for traders, namely the ex-dividend day. Consistent with these models, we find that order placement is more aggressive before stocks begin trading ex-dividend. Stocks with higher expected costs of delaying execution experience larger declines in order aggressiveness from the cum-day to the ex-day. Waiting costs also impact effective bid-ask spreads, which fall on the cum-day before rising on the ex-day.",

        "abstract": "This paper uses bivariate and multivariate wavelet approaches to revisit the co-movements between the Volatility Uncertainty Index (VIX) and Bitcoin (BTC). This is achieved by accounting for the impacts of the three major global factors, namely the U.S. Economic Policy Uncertainty Index (EPU), the Crude Oil Volatility Index (OVX), and the Geopolitical Risk Index (GPR). To do this, we use Wavelet Coherence (WC), Cross Wavelet Transform (CWT), Power Wavelet Coherence (PWC), and Multiple Wavelet Coherence (MWC) approaches. The results show that the BTC-VIX relationship varies across time and at high and low frequencies. Moreover, we find positive (or in-phase) co-movements between both variables while a negative co-movement (out-of-phase) is observed at both high and low frequencies. VIX news has a prediction power on BTC price returns over different frequencies. The results of PWC and MWC show that OVX, EPU, and GPR factors affect the BTC-VIX nexus under different frequencies. Finally, correlations between BTC-uncertainty indices are dependent upon investment horizons. The results of our research are of interest and importance to investors, portfolio managers, and policy-makers, as the results have practical applications to inform their decision-making.",

The spillovers are higher for oil-exporting countries than oil-importing countries. Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) are the main contributors to spillovers in the short and intermediate terms. Brent oil, Egypt, Morocco, and Turkey are the net receivers of spillovers in the short term, and they switch to become net contributors to spillovers in the intermediate term.

The results show that the spilllovers is dynamic and crisis-sensitive. Furthermore, adding GBs and oil futures to stock portfolio reduces the spillover size during turmoil periods. The short-term spillovers (up to five trading days) represent the largest proportion of the total spillovers. A significant jump in spillovers is observed in the early of COVID-19 outbreak (March\u00e2\u0080\u0093April 2020). Interestingly, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, and UK are the net transmitters of spillovers, whereas Japan and GBs are the net recipients of the spillovers, irrespective of time horizons.

Wavelet coherence analysis reveals significant co-movements between G7 stock markets and both oil and GBs. The co-movements are more pronounced in both medium and long terms and during COVID-19 spread where both oil and GBs lead stock markets. GBs provide higher diversification benefits to G7 investors than oil in the short-term. The hedging is expensive at the long term for GBs and intermediate term for WTI oil.

Monero is the largest transmitter of risk, and Ethereum is the largest receiver of risk from other markets. Monero and Ripple are net contributors of spillovers, whereas Bitcoin, DASH, Ethereum, and Litecoin are net receivers of spillovers. The correlation ranks for different scales show that the correlations increase with scale, indicating higher diversification benefits at low scales.

To do so, we use the Diebold and Yilmaz (2014), the TVP-VAR model, and the frequency spillover index by Barun\u00c3\u00adk and K\u00c5\u0099ehl\u00c3\u00adk (2018).

Green Bond is net transmitters of spillovers in the system at the short term and net receivers at the long term. S&P500 and silver (USDX and oil) are net transmitters (receivers) of short- and long-term spillovers. Gold and VIX are net receivers of short-term spillovers and net transmitters of long-term spillovers. COVID-19 crisis has more effects on the short-term spillover, which reaches its highest level early 2020. COVID-19 and time horizons lead the direction and the magnitude of spillovers. The Quantile-on-Quantile regression analysis shows significant nonlinear relationships between markets under study. More interestingly, we show that green bonds and gold are safe haven assets for US equity investors during COVID-19. On the other hand, a mixed portfolio offers higher diversification benefits. Finally, hedging effectiveness is dependent on COVID-19 and time horizon.",

        "abstract": "Motivated by large oil price swings, high economic and geopolitical uncertainties, and the financialization of oil, this paper examines the frequency spillovers and co-movements between oil shocks (risk and demand) and the stock markets of top oil-producer and consumer countries, namely, Canada, China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and the US. The analysis uses the time-domain spillover index of [1], the frequency-domain spillover of [2]; and the wavelet coherence approach. The findings reveal that spillovers run from the U.S., Canada, and, to a lesser extent, Russia to oil shocks. On the other hand, oil shocks, Saudi Arabia, and China constitute net receivers of shocks. The intensity of spillovers is heavier in the short-term frequency than in the intermediate- and long-term. Furthermore, the direction of spillovers is more defined in the long-term. The U.S. stock market exerts a strong impact on oil risk in general, but the impact is stronger in the short-term. Conversely, an oil demand shock is susceptible to innovations from Canada and Russia that are stronger in the long-term. This means that oil risk shock stemming from innovations in financial markets is short-lived and dissipates quickly due to quick reactions from market participants. On the contrary, long-term links characterize the relationship between oil demand shock and financial markets, mirroring the macroeconomic nature of the linkages. Finally, while the 2008 crisis, EDC, oil price crash, and the COVID-19 pandemic coincided with strong spillovers in the short-term, the COVID-19 era was marked by higher spillovers in the long term. The findings provide important information for investors and policymakers in terms of diversification, risk management, and efforts to mitigate contagion.",

The results show significant lower tail dependence and upper tail independence between oil and non-ferrous metals markets. The lower temporal dependence is positive and heterogeneous between oil and non-ferrous markets and intensified during the onset of the global financial crisis (GFC) for copper, lead, and tin markets. The upside and downside spillovers from oil to non-ferrous markets and vice versa is significant and increased during times of GFC, oil price crash, and COVID-19 outbreak. The highest spillover effects are observed for the aluminum market, which is very vulnerable to oil price instabilities. Moreover, the spillover effects are asymmetric for all markets. Finally, we find that the CDB for aluminum and nickel are quite similar, and for lead, tin and zinc are also closed the same. The CDB is higher for nickel regardless of the portfolio composition and the probability level. The diversification gains decrease during stress market periods. Our findings have important implications in terms of funds allocation and portfolio design.",

        "abstract": "This paper examines co-movements, risk spillovers, and portfolio implications between precious metals (gold, platinum, and silver) and main energy (crude oil, natural gas, gasoline, and gas oil) futures price returns. We use the spillover index, different wavelet approaches, and different diversification tools. The results show dynamic volatility among markets that are intensified during financial and oil crises. Gold and oil are a net contributor to volatility whereas the remaining markets are a net receiver of risk irrespective of the market status. Moreover, we find insignificant (weak) co-movements between energy and precious metals at high (medium and low) frequency. The global financial crisis followed by the great oil price bust in 2014 intensifies return co-movements at low frequency. The results of the multivariate wavelet approach reveal that gas oil, natural gas, and gasoline intensify co-movements between crude oil and precious metals. The results of our research are of interest to investors, fund managers, and policy-makers having practical applications for better decision-making.",

We use the time-frequency domain spillover index methodology of Barun\u00c3\u00adk and K\u00c5\u0099ehl\u00c3\u00adk (2018). The results show that the UK stock market is the largest contributor to and receipt of short-term spillovers. Gold, palladium, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Bulgarian, Mexican, and Russian stock markets are the next receivers of spillover. German and Australian stock markets are, respectively, the largest source and receipt of spillovers in the long term. Furthermore, the spillovers in the short term are higher than their counterparts in the long term, and they are more pronounced during the global financial crisis (GFC). Precious metals contribute more to the forecasting variance for stock markets in the top precious metal exporter economies than in the top precious metal importer economies. They receive more spillovers from stock markets in the top precious metal exporters irrespective of time horizons. In addition, the spillover effects in the short term are higher than their counterparts in the long term in top precious metal exporters. Precious metals provide a better hedging effectiveness than individual equity portfolios. Finally, the hedging effectiveness is higher in the short term relative to the long term for stock markets of precious metal-exporter economies.",

Various copula functions along with the Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) technique and the Conditional Value at Risk (CoVaR) measure are used. The results show evidence of a negative and positive average dependence between energy (crude oil, natural gas, and gasoline) and almost all MENA stock markets before and after the oil crash in the short term. In the long term, we find a significant average dependence before the crash and an upper tail dependence after the crash between crude oil and almost all the MENA stock markets. Natural gas exhibits a positive and upper tail dependence with almost all MENA markets before the crash and an average dependence after the crash. For gasoline, the results however are mixed for the average and tail dependence before and after the crash. Furthermore, the dependence is higher in the long than the short term and after the oil crash than before it. The VaR and CoVaR values show that the expected loss of portfolios is more significant after the crash and in the long term. Finally, the stock markets of the oil-exporting MENA countries are more affected by the energy price shocks than the oil-importing MENA countries as reflected in the intensification of the dependence level and the systemic risk results.",

The results show zero tail dependence between oil and stock returns at the short term. In contrast, we find a lower tail independence and an upper tail dependence at the long term. Our results highlight that oil futures serve as hedge assets at short term and a safe haven asset at the long term. Furthermore, we find significant and asymmetric risk spillovers from oil to ASEAN markets. The downside and upside spillovers are higher at the long term than short term and increase during the GFC, the recent oil crisis, and COVID-19 periods. Finally, we show that an equally weighted portfolio provides highest diversification benefits at both lower and medium tail distributions with the exception of Malaysian market. The diversification benefits of oil are sizeable for less coupling markets and fall during times of GFC and oil crisis.",

        "abstract": "This paper examines quantile return spillovers and the connectedness between crude oil futures and key precious metals (PMs) using the approach developed by Ando et al. (2022). Our findings show that using the cross-quantilogram directional spillover method results in significant spillovers from oil to PMs under an extreme downside oil market scenario. Oil impacts both palladium and platinum under an extreme upside oil market status. Under normal oil market conditions, we show insignificant spillovers from oil to PMs. We find an insignificant dependence of PMs on oil during bearish markets, indicating that PMs serve as a safe haven asset. However, we find that oil and palladium are net receivers of spillovers across quantiles, except for palladium at intermediate quantiles, and other PMs are net contributors of spillovers across all quantiles. The spillovers are higher at extreme quantiles and increase during extreme events. Furthermore, we find no connection between platinum and gold under normal market conditions and a weak connection between platinum and both silver and palladium during bearish market scenarios. Precious metals are good diversifying assets for oil portfolios. The hedging strategy using PMs is less expensive during the COVID-19 pandemic than before it, with the exception of platinum. Finally, PMs offer higher hedging effectiveness before the pandemic crisis, whereas palladium provides the highest hedging effectiveness before and during the pandemic crisis.",

We apply the spillover index by Diebold and Yilmaz (2012) and wavelet methods. The results show significant risk spillovers among the leading energy futures markets. Moreover, the spillovers are intensified during the financial crisis, oil crisis and COVID-19 outbreak. WTI crude oil is the highest net contributor of volatility spillovers to the other markets, whereas the other energy markets are net receivers of spillovers for the different sub periods, with the exception of natural gas before the GFC and during COVID-19 as well as Brent oil during COVID-19. Furthermore, the results show significant integration and multiscale co-movements among energy futures. Natural gas asset offers better diversification benefits to crude oil, heating oil, gasoline and gas oil under short term. Finally, the diversification gains diminish as scales rise. The optimal weight, hedge ratios and hedging effectiveness are time varying and crises-sensitive. These findings have significant implications for energy traders and policymakers to inform their decision-making.",

The results show co-movements between oil price and stock market returns at the lower scale or in the long-term. Coherence between oil and stock markets reaches maximal levels during the period of the 2008 financial crisis and the ensuing slow economic recovery from 2009. The strong co-movements between crude oil price returns and BRICS stock market returns take place after the removal of the effects of natural gas price returns. Multivariate coherency shows strong contributions of stock market returns and natural gas price returns to crude oil price returns. Given the less co-movements between natural gas and stock markets, natural gas provides higher diversification benefits. The risk is highest in the short-run compared to the medium-and long-term.",

Our technique is tightly based on a general intertemporal asset-pricing model, and relies on estimating and comparing expected risk-free rates across assets. Expected risk-free rates are allowed to vary freely over time, constrained only by the fact that they are equal across (risk-adjusted) assets. Assets are allowed to have general risk characteristics, and are constrained only by a factor model of covariances over short time periods. The technique is undemanding in terms of both data and estimation. We find that expected risk-free rates vary dramatically over time, unlike short interest rates. Further, the S&P 500 market seems to be well integrated, and the NASDAQ is generally (but not always) integrated. However, the NASDAQ is poorly integrated with the S&P 500.",

The test methodology adjusts for thin trading, pre- and post-revision abnormal performance and sample selection criterion effects. The models used to characterize returns include factors such as illiquidity and large trade activity. The positive and transitory median changes in traded volumes become insignificant when market-adjusted volumes are examined. No permanent effects on trade and analyst price behavior are identified. Traditional market-adjusted abnormal return inferences are not robust. The announcement window abnormal returns are smaller for annual versus non-annual index additions. This suggests that a longer advance notice period more than compensates for a larger number of simultaneous index revisions. The findings support the price pressure and liquidity hypotheses. Temporary changes in liquidity costs temporarily move stock prices from their equilibrium values, and announcement window abnormal returns are essentially reversed in subsequent periods.",

For that purpose, the behavior of the implied volatilities from the U.S. and Finnish markets is investigated around the employment, producer price index (PPI) and consumer price index (CPI) reports. The results confirm the hypothesis that implied volatility increases prior to the macroeconomic news release and drops after the announcement in both markets. This implies that uncertainty associated with the U.S. macroeconomic news releases is reflected in foreign stock markets as well.

The tests cover the period 1980 to 1998. For a sample of highly scrutinized and visible firms strong seasonality in excess returns is reported. However, the firms in our sample have unusually low excess returns in January and returns adjust upwards over the remainder of the year. The results hold even after we control for various risk differences among the stocks of our sample. Further, this article\u00e2\u0080\u0099s findings imply that the January effect is not as pervasive across risk classes and industry sectors as earlier studies using aggregate data have shown it to be. The disaggregated data of this study provide evidence in support of the gamesmanship hypothesis, but not the tax-loss selling hypothesis. Whenever a January effect is observed, the last quarter of the year tends to be weak for those companies in our sample that experienced a strong January. The opposite is true when a January effect is not evident, as the gamesmanship hypothesis would predict.",

We slice a trading day in buckets of several minutes\u00e2\u0080\u0099 length to obtain one estimate of the composite variable probability of informed trading (PIN) per day. This approach makes PIN applicable in short horizon event studies. Convergence rates are above 95 % even for the most liquid stocks and the model\u00e2\u0080\u0099s underlying assumptions of independence for the arrival of traders and information events are fulfilled to a much higher degree than in the original approach.

Our analysis is based on the stock price reaction to profit warnings issued by a sample of firms listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The standard event study methodology indicates the presence of price reversal patterns following both positive and negative warnings. However, incorporating time-varying betas, event-induced variance and conditional heteroskedasticity in the modelling process results in post-negative-warning price patterns that are consistent with the predictions of the efficient market hypothesis. These adjustments also cause the statistical significance of some post-positive-warning cumulative abnormal returns to disappear and their magnitude to drop to an extent that minor transaction costs would eliminate the profitability of the contrarian strategy.",

Consistent with the notion that the peak in demand is driven by a propensity to gamble that is associated with inattention, we find underreaction to earnings news issued at the ToM by lottery-type firms located in areas with many gambling investors. Lottery-type firms are more likely to issue bad earnings news at ToM, thus benefiting from a less negative price reaction. Similarly, seasoned equity offerings (SEOs) by lottery-type firms are often strategically timed at the ToM, conceivably to take advantage of local retail investors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 underreaction and thereby temper the typically negative immediate stock price reaction to the issuance news. Further suggestive of strategic exploitation of local investors peak in demand at the ToM period, lottery-type firms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 SEOs at the ToM are also more likely to be offered via an accelerated method that saves the direct marketing costs associated with other offer methods.",

Specifically, we examine the impact of short-sale restriction on stock price efficiency when firms make public earnings announcements. Using data from the Hong Kong stock market, where some stocks are eligible for and others are prohibited from short selling, we find significantly lower post-announcement returns with high economic magnitude for short-sale prohibited stocks with both positive and negative news shocks. The reduction in informational efficiency due to short-sale restriction persists several months after the earnings announcement. The informational inefficiency due to short-sale restriction is particularly severe for firms with negative announcement period shocks and subject to greater differences in opinion.",

We first find that levels of customer complaints predict future auto recalls and their financial consequences, suggesting that these publicly available customer complaints contain value-relevant information. We then find that customer complaints are not contemporaneously associated with stock returns but predict large negative abnormal stock returns during the period following the recall announcement. Thus, we find that the market generally fails to impound the information contained in customer complaints in a timely manner. We then examine whether mutual funds, as sophisticated investors, appear to use the complaint data and find that, consistent with the overall market, in the aggregate they do not appear to use the complaint data to inform their trades until after recall announcements. However, mutual funds that focus more of their trades in the auto industry appear to pay more attention to the complaint data and trade consistent with the data before recall announcements. We then find that the top five executives of the car manufacturers in our sample are significant sellers of personal shares prior to the announcement of auto recalls, particularly when customer complaints are high. Our findings suggest that insiders\u00e2\u0080\u0099 informational advantage is at least in part due to general investor limited attention to publicly available information.",

However, our investigation shows that the number of empirical intensity pairs is significantly more than the one these models assume, and this number changes daily. Therefore, we propose a new model which, by using the change-point detection technique, can adjust this number according to the data. The model also considers autocorrelation, which is lacking in the existing PIN models. In addition, we show that the proposed model can examine how public information transfers to individual stock price and quantify transfer delay.",

We find that the extent to which mutual funds concentrate their trading in the auto industry is positively associated with their incorporation of the complaint information into their trading decisions both before and after auto recall announcements. We provide evidence that trading concentration by mutual funds is more consistent with the information advantage explanation rather than behavioral explanations for concentration such as overconfidence or familiarity. However, we find that pension funds, regardless of their level of trading concentration, do not use the customer complaint information to inform their trading decisions. Our findings suggest that pension funds concentrate trading for reasons other than short-term information advantage, suggesting that the underlying reason for trading concentration can differ by the type of institutional investor.",

Using a Markov-switching framework, allowing for variation between high volatility and low volatility states, we find that price momentum is significantly more influenced by earnings momentum in the high volatility state. Further for price momentum we find that loser firms display a higher degree of differential response to earnings momentum across the low and high volatility states than winner firms. Limited financing and investor sensitivity to future investment opportunities might explain these two results. Additional analysis indicates that loser firms tend to be more financially constrained. The results are robust using alternative instrument variables.",

        "abstract": "Whether to pay dividends or not is a critical decision that every company must make. Conversely, whether to invest in a divided paying company is decision investors must consider. However, the relationship between dividend and share returns is not clear and how shareholders react to dividend increases or decreases is still a puzzle. This paper seeks to identify if cash dividend change announcements have any effect on share returns. It also examines whether stock price returns react the same to an increase and a decrease in dividend announced. Using daily closing prices from 2005-2012, the paper employs a 40-day event methodology to examine the reaction of share price returns to dividend change announcements before, during and after the event. Results show, dividend announcements have a significant effect on share price returns. Dividend decreases resulted in negative returns while dividend increases resulted in positive returns. Dividend decreases cause a larger decline in returns than an increase leads an increase in returns. Based on this evidence, dividend announcements have information content and hence dividend-paying companies listed in Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE) should consider this before announcing a change in dividend",

The study applies the multivariate cointegration methodology to establish the possible causal relations between these variables. The cointegration test and the vector error correction model demonstrates the evidence of positive long-run relationships between real stock returns and measures of aggregate economic activity including industrial production, consumer price index, money supply and real exchange rate. The long-term elasticity coefficients of the macroeconomic variables on stock returns display relationships that are theoretically grounded. Further analysis using variance decompositions lends evidence of the dominant influence of certain macroeconomic variables namely; consumer price index, money supply and real exchange rate in forecasting stock price variance.",

        "abstract": "A Parent company occasionally spins off a wholly owned subsidiary or division, if it helps improve operational efficiency, reduce information asymmetry, reduce tax liability, and improve corporate governance. Therefore, it is suggested that corporate spin-offs create shareholders' value. It is also suggested that spin-off decisions may result in redistribution of wealth from debt holders to shareholders, because a part of the total assets of parent company are transferred to a newly incorporated independent company that replaces the wholly owned subsidiary or division. This study examines the value effect of 25 such corporate spin-off events that occurred in Singapore. Results show that parent shareholders gain about 15.73 percent value after spin-offs. Of which, 6.62 percent gain occurs in spin-off stocks while the remaining 9.11 percent occurs in parent stocks. The finding is consistent with the argument that corporate spin-offs have economic benefits to help increase shareholders' value. It is also found that total spin-off value gain is significantly correlated with the debt asset ratio of parent firms, which sheds light on the possibility of wealth redistribution from the bondholders to shareholders due to change in parent capital structure after spin-off.",

This paper provides a fresh look at monthly seasonality in 34 international equity markets over the period from January 1988 to December 2010. Unlike prior findings, we do not find a significant January effect except perhaps for 3 markets. Instead, we find significantly larger and positive anomalies across the vast majority of these markets for December and April. The results further suggest the presence of significant negative anomalies for June, August, and September across most global markets in the sample.",

Employing a quantile-based connectedness approach and quantile cross-spectral dependence, our analysis spans from July 02, 2007 to May 31, 2023, encompassing diverse market conditions and events. These methodologies help identify interdependence patterns in extreme market scenarios at different time intervals. Key findings show variations in how these stock markets respond to oil shocks, depending on market conditions and quantiles. Demand-related shocks have the most significant spillover effects on the United States, Russia, and India, while risk-related shocks dominate as transmitters of shocks to the United States, China, and India in median quantiles. Market interconnectedness strengthens during extreme market conditions, reflecting historical events. Additionally, bearish markets offer diversification opportunities between these countries and crude oil. This study emphasizes the need for tailored investment strategies, monitoring global oil demand trends, dynamic portfolio management, crude oil inclusion in portfolios, and proactive responses to market players and geopolitical events. These insights benefit investors and policymakers seeking to optimize strategies in the interconnected global financial landscape.",

Previous studies have shown that the oil-stock market nexus is asymmetric and strongly vulnerable to international events. Using daily data of ten Chinese stock sector indices and the West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures over the period from July 2, 2007, to September 3, 2021, we examine the quantile return spillovers and interconnectedness between these markets using the approach of Ando et al. (2022), showing that return spillovers between the markets under investigation are more pronounced under bearish market conditions than during bullish ones. Major financial, political, energy, and COVID-19 pandemic events have magnified spillovers. Irrespective of the state of the market, oil is always a net receiver of return spillovers. Moreover, for all sectors other than materials, the sector that acts as a net receiver during bearish market conditions becomes a net contributor during bullish market conditions, and vice versa. During the COVID-19 period, the hedging technique was the most cost-effective. In the event of a global pandemic, the IT, financial, telecommunication, and energy sectors can benefit from oil's higher hedging effectiveness. Oil was a cheaper hedging asset during the pandemic, and it offered the highest hedging effectiveness to utilities before the outbreak and to the financial sector during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

We find that the first specification, given by the hypothesis of i.i.d. returns, is clearly rejected by the data, while the statistical evidence against the second specification, given by the more general hypothesis of uncorrelated or linearly independent returns, is much weaker, especially for the MIB30 returns. In the second part of the paper we study the possibility that a serially correlated process implied by a specific model of time-variation in expected returns could generate a degree of linear dependence similar to that observed in actual returns. We find that a combination of fast mean reversion in expected returns and small pricing errors in realized returns produces an autocorrelation pattern similar to that actually observed.",

It looks for evidence on whether listed companies manage information before or after the occurrence of extreme returns. We found divergences between the news coverage performed in situations of abnormal positive returns and in opposite situations, which seem to result from actions promoted by these companies deliberately. In particular, calls to the first page of the newspapers are more prevalent for positive events, which indicates that companies, in advance, promote information by communicating it to the media. In addition, before the event, companies are proportionally more cited as a source of the news for positive events. This indicates that companies seek to capitalize the positive impact of the favourable situation they subsequently disclose to the market. In the period after the occurrence of extreme abnormal returns, companies are more often a source of the news for negative events, seeking to mitigate the impact of the relevant fact. Concerning the provision of interviews and the publication of advertisements, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no evidence that the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s behaviour is distinct depending on the sign of the verified abnormal return.",

        "abstract": "This paper analyzes the impact of economic news, that is, the difference between economic announcements and what was anticipated, on financial markets. The three contributions of this paper are, first, the market expectation is derived from economic derivative prices that allow a full distribution for the market expectation to be derived. Economic derivatives data better predict financial market movements and also allow for testing whether there is information in the high moments of the distribution. Second, high frequency financial data allows us to test for the optimal window and discover how long it takes financial markets to digest and react to news. Finally, by using a U.S. and a European economic announcement and a wide range of financial markets, this paper compares announcements to show which are important for which markets. I find that high frequency financial data leads to a much bigger and more significant news announcement effect over previous studies that used end-of day data. Further, financial markets react very quickly to news. Unlike other studies that have assumed a 25-30 minute window, I have demonstrated that the announcement window is often as little as just one minute. Using the richness of the economic derivatives-based expectations data I determine when higher moments of the expectations distribution are useful in determining the announcement effect. I also show in which markets, and for which announcements, good news and bad news have asymmetric effects; and, in which markets are most responsive to which announcements. Finally, I have highlighted some of the interesting results that traders or risk managers might want to delve into in more detail.",

        "title": "Assessment of investment returns through the prism of investment strategies: comparison of performance of the most successful investors and the Slovenian funds",
        "abstract": "In this paper, the authors analyze the investment philosophies and strategies of three financial mogul companies to find out what strategies they apply, yielding high returns. They also analyze their performance compared to Slovenian mutual funds and the broader stock market. The authors focus on some key research hypotheses. First, they are interested in assessing and monitoring the company's future intrinsic value, which refers to a fundamental, objective value contained in a financial asset. If the market price is below this value, this financial asset may be a good buy, or if it is above, it may be a good sale. While studying the investment strategies, they check if such an assessment enables above-average investment returns. Second, the authors state that the fund's profitability and risk reflect the chosen investment strategy. Investors generally expect higher returns from riskier investments. Risk tolerance is one of the critical factors determining the return on investment. Typically, higher-risk investments have the potential for higher returns, but they also come with a greater risk of loss. The authors compare and test how the risk is embedded in the investment strategies of three renowned financial investors and Slovenia mutual funds. Third, the authors hypothesised that time and patience are among the most critical factors in investing. The authors' fourth research hypothesis relates to the question if the stock market always accurately reflect the value of individual companies. Many researchers today argue that some market participants behave irrationally, what leads to market inefficiency. They suggest that the financial market can never be perfectly efficient. In the theoretical part of the paper, the authors begin with a brief literature overview underlying how different factors affect investment returns, especially focusing on the indicator ROI. Further, they shortly represent the investment strategies of Buffett, Ackman, and Palihapitiya. In the empirical part of the paper, they perform some financial calculations \u00e2\u0080\u0094 annual return, average annual return, annual standard deviation, Sharpe ratio, and then proceed with a Monte Carlo simulation and a CAPM model. The author's findings show that a deep understanding and accurate assessment of a company's intrinsic value leads to above-average returns. The risk and return of a fund are tied to the strategy chosen, with those willing to accept a higher risk often achieving higher returns. They underline the importance of time and patience in investing and observe that the stock market does not always reflect the exact value of an individual company accurately, which emphasizes the importance of critical judgement and not blindly following market trends.",

The second objective is to validate that analysts who issue a recommendation may not be impartial (not supporting any of the sides involved in an argument) because the largest group of recommendations issued is \u00e2\u0080\u009cbuy\u00e2\u0080\u009d recommendations. Design/methodology/approach \u00e2\u0080\u0093 This study was conducted based on all the \u00e2\u0080\u009cbuy\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009csell\u00e2\u0080\u009d recommendations issued during the period between January 1, 2004 and December 31, 2016 for companies listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange, using data from www.bankier.pl. The annual forecast rates of return were determined for all the recommendations included in the survey. The expected rates of return were determined for each recommendation based on the information collated from the Bloomberg database. The regression analysis enabled the exploration of the relationship between the actual rates of return and the rates of return predicted in recommendations. Findings \u00e2\u0080\u0093 It was determined that investing on the basis of the information included in \u00e2\u0080\u009csell\u00e2\u0080\u009d recommendations might make it possible to avoid unprofitable investments. At the same time, the study shows that an investment strategy compliant with \u00e2\u0080\u009cbuy\u00e2\u0080\u009d recommendations does not let the investor achieve the expected rates of return on an investment in the capital market in the long term.

Results suggest that the profitability of the technical rules tested by BLL have recently disappeared on DJIA, and that these rules have performed better on the ISE-100 index. I notice one exception which BLL overlooked: The 22-day simple moving average rule, which has been widely used by short-term traders, still performs positively on DJIA and produces significantly positive profits on the ISE-100 index, even after transaction costs. I use results on these samples with contrasting characteristics to develop hypotheses on the determinants of the profitability of these simple technical trading rules.",

        "title": "The market reaction to stock splits: Evidence from Germany",
        "abstract": "Although stock splits seem to be a purely cosmetic event, there exists ample empirical evidence from the United States that stock splits are associated with abnormal returns on both the announcement and the execution day, and additionally with an increase in variance following the ex-day. This paper investigates the market reaction to stock splits using a set of German firms. Consistent with the U.S. findings, similar effects are observed for the sample of German stock splits. Institutional differences between Germany and the U.S. allow to disentangle the three main hypotheses on the announcement effect - signalling, liquidity, and neglected firm hypothesis - to gain further insights into their relative explanation power. This paper argues that legal restrictions strongly limit the ability of German companies to use a stock split for signaling. Consistently, abnormal returns around the announcement day are much lower in Germany than in the U.S. Although a significant increase in liquidity can be found after the split crosssectional tests do not lend any support to the hypothesis that price changes are positively related to liquidity changes. This is in contrast to the results of Muscarella/Vetsuypens (1996) and Amihud/Mendelson/Lauterbach (1997). The paper shows that the announcement effect to German stock splits is best explained by a neglected firm effect. On the methodological side the effect of thin trading on event study results is examined. Using tradeto-trade returns increases the significance of abnormal returns but the difference between alternative return measurement methods is relatively small in short event periods. Thus, the observed market reaction cannot be attributed to measurement problems caused by thin trading.",

Past research has shown that companies benefit from executing blockchain projects, but little is known about specific value and risk drivers. Hence, we provide evidence for several conditions under which blockchain provides additional firm market value. Moreover, we test whether blockchain announcements lead to changes in the systematic risk of firms. Theoretically founded on the resource-based view, we utilize the event study methodology, supplemented by a multivariate regression and a firm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s beta analysis. We find that stock markets react positively to corporate blockchain news if the announcement is related to a blockchain consortium or partnership, is declared by a tech company, or if the announcement is a follow-up announcement to initial blockchain news. Moreover, our findings show that blockchain announcements do not lead to significant changes in a firm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s systematic risk.",

The Efficient Markets Hypothesis (hereafter the EMH) holds that there should be no discernible pattern in share price data or the prices of other frequently traded financial instruments, as financial markets are efficient. Prices therefore should follow an information-free random-walk. Nevertheless, technical analysis is a common and presumably profitable practice among investment professionals.

The subset of technical trading research which is concerned with the application of GAs, GPs and neural networks is very new and underdeveloped and therefore of considerable potential. The most notable empirical work which has been done in this area is that of Neely, Dittmar and Weller (1996, 1997), Neely and Weller (2001) and Neely (2001). We have also done some work in this area ourselves (Fyfe et al. 1999, Marney et al. 2000). The theoretical underpinning for this kind of approach to finding technical trading patterns is provided by the work of Arthur et al. (1997). Using the main six trading currencies, Neely et al. (1996, 1997) find strong evidence of economically significant out-of-sample excess returns to technical trading rules identified by their genetic program. In Allen and Karjaleinen (1999) a genetic algorithm is used to find technical trading rules for the S&P index. Compared to a simple buy-and-hold strategy, these trading rules lead to positive excess returns which are statistically and economically significant. In Fyfe et. al. (1999), a GP is used to discover a successful \u00c3\u008ebuy\u00c3\u008c rule. This discovery, as such, however, was not really a refutation of the EMH, as it was really a form of timing specific buy and hold, which was triggered only once. Nevertheless, the return is superior to buy and hold. Using the S&P 500 index, Neely (2001) finds no evidence that technical trading rules identified by a GP significantly outperform buy-and-hold on a risk-adjusted basis. For the case of intraday trading on the forex market, Neely and Weller (2001) find no evidence of excess returns to trading rules derived from a GP and an optimised linear forecasting model. Indeed Neely (2001) observes that a number of studies\u00c3\u00b7'have generally evaluated raw excess returns rather than explicitly risk-adjusted returns, leaving unclear the implications of their work for the efficient markets hypothesis' (2001, p.1). On the other hand, Neely et al. (1996, 1997) did calculate betas associated with foreign currency portfolio holdings, and did not find evidence of excessive risk bearing. Brown, Geotzman and Kumar (1998) and Bessember and Chan (1998) can also be cited in favour of the hypothesis of superior risk-adjusted returns from technical trading signals. Marney et al. (2000) looked again at their 1999 findings by, amongst other things, adjusting for risk. It was found that although there were other rules which apparently performed well by being very active in the market, the impressive returns to these rules turn out on closer inspection to be illusory, as risk adjusted returns did not compare well with simple buy and hold. Nevertheless, paradoxically, we did find a useful role for technical trading. It is possible to substantially improve on buy and hold by timing it right. Hence our argument is that it is worth analysing the market to find a good intervention point. Purpose and method of the investigation Given that very little work has been done on generating technical trading rules which produce excess risk-adjusted profits, and given that the empirical evidence is somewhat ambiguous, there is clearly considerable scope for additional work in this area. What we propose to do then is to re-examine our previous findings, this time within a more rigorous framework which makes use of a wider data set, more extensive use of techniques of risk adjustment, and more demanding assessment of the robustness of the result with respect to GP representation. 1. Hypotheses Can the GP generate technical trading rules which will generate risk-adjusted excess returns out of sample? Secondly, the is there any further evidence for 'timing-specific' buy and hold. Thirdly, are there any technical trading rules which generalise across data sets or time-periods? 2. Data Set Our data set is drawn from long time series for 5 US shares from a disparate set of industrial sectors and also the S&P 500. 3. Risk adjustment In this study we look at a variety of risk measures including Betas, Sharpe ratios and the X* statistic. 4. The GP - As in Marney et al. (2000) we consider how robust our conclusion is with respect to the GP method used.",

In simple terms, EMH states that by predicting the future development we are not able to achieve the profits superior to the profits of the market index when these are adjusted for the risk and transactions costs are deducted. On the other hand, there exist works providing evidences that markets are not efficient.

        "abstract": "During the latest episode of general election held in Malaysia, it is observed that the FBMKLCI index was lifted 62.52 points in a day soon after the announcement of election outcome. Moreover, the index registered a highest gain of 96.29 points in the middle of the intra-day trade. This suggests that investors who had got the right direction could make profitable intra-day trading the next trading day of the general election date. Results from statistical analysis uncover significant before-election-effect and after-election-effect from the most recent general elections held in Malaysia. Different subsets of macroeconomic variables are found to have significant role on stock market return depending on the market situation. Remarkably, when there was close fight between the two major political parties during the 2008 and 2013 election years, political uncertainty showed up its negative and significant role in influencing the stock market return. The major implication of these findings is that while investors may seek abnormal returns before and after the next general election, which is around the corner, they will have to pay attention on the influence of macroeconomic variables and political uncertainty on stock market return during the election year.",

We find evidence of a clear trade-off between order aggressiveness and quantity: more aggressive orders tend to be smaller in size. The increased competition (demand) suggested by increased depth on the same (opposite) side of the market leads to less (more) aggressive orders in smaller (larger) size. This holds for the depths at both the best and off-best prices, even though off-best depths are not observable to dealers.",

        "abstract": "This study examines the multiscale spillovers and nonlinear causalities between the crude oil futures market and the stock markets of the United States (US), Canada, China, Russia, and Venezuela before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using the wavelet coherency method, we find strong co-movement between the oil futures market and these five stock markets, particularly from March 2020 to May 2020 (initial period of the COVID-19 outbreak) at high frequency. Furthermore, we find positive co-movements at low frequency during the overall COVID-19 period. This finding suggests that the bearish trend of stock markets is associated with a downward movement in oil prices. Using the wavelet-based Granger causality approach, we find that the oil and stock indices have less co-movement on a smaller scale but greater movement on a larger scale across all periods. As an exception, the Russian market is significantly influenced by oil prices, even on a small scale, before the COVID-19 period, but not after the beginning of the pandemic.

Furthermore, we find that investors should hold more oil futures than stock shares in their portfolios for all periods. This evidence confirms that oil instruments are important for hedging during normal periods and act as safe-haven assets during crisis periods. We observe that the U.S. and Canadian stock markets were more affected by oil price shocks than were other countries.",

Using both a market index and sector indices as benchmarks, our IPO sample shows significant short-run Cumulative Abnormal Return (CAR) of 4.8% and an insignificant CAR up to 4 years after the initial date. While the proceeds collected are negatively related to short-run underpricing, the quality of the underwriter shows a positive relationship to the same variable. When we classify underwriters as \u00e2\u0080\u009clong term players\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009csporadics\u00e2\u0080\u009d, the former show a significantly higher short-run CAR.

According to the results in case of positive and negative EPS surprises (deviation by more than \u00c2\u00b12% from analyst consensus) price reactions are almost complete and happen in the same direction as the deviation promptly, which however are not followed by significant abnormal returns starting from the second day after the announcement. In the group of positive news, the price reaction stemming from EPS surprises proved to be significantly higher in case of tech companies, however there is no significant difference between the two groups in case of negative surprises.",

        "abstract": "Recent evidence of excessive comovement among stocks following index additions (Barberis, Shleifer, and Wurgler, 2005) and stock splits (Green and Hwang, 2009) challenges traditional finance theory. Based on a simple model, we show that the bivariate regressions relied upon in the literature often provide little or no information about the economic magnitude of the phenomenon of interest, and the coefficients in these regressions are very sensitive to time-variation in the characteristics of the return processes that are unrelated to excess comovement. Instead, univariate regressions of the stock return on the returns of the group it is leaving (e.g., non-S&P stocks) and the group it is joining (e.g., S&P stocks) reveal the relevant information. When we reexamine the empirical evidence using control samples matched on past returns and compute Dimson betas, almost all evidence of excess comovement disappears. The results in the literature are consistent with changes in the fundamental factor loadings of the stocks. One key element to understanding these striking results is that, in both the examples we study, the stocks exhibit strong returns prior to the event in question. We document the heretofore unknown empirical regularity that winner stocks exhibit increases in betas. Thus, much of the apparent excess comovement is just a manifestation of momentum.",

        "abstract": "The deepening of financial integration in the EU has accelerated in the last decade. The expansion of trade relations, intensification of investment flows and capital market development evidence strengthening of financial integration processes. Particularly, the large number of foreign companies listed on domestic equity market enhances financial integration. In this regard, the enlargement of stock markets of Central and Eastern European countries and efficient capital allocation define further integration prospects. The stock market efficiency depends mainly on adequate pricing of capital and risk. The rational investment expectations and information efficiency positively impact trading strategies and eliminates the presence of undervalued and overvalued assets. This leads to the high competitiveness of stock market and decreases the likelihood of abnormal profits. Studies of stock market efficiency of CEE countries and the correlations of CEE capital markets with Western European markets have a significant importance owing to the ongoing financial integration and impact of financial crisis. I run two tests to check the capital market efficiency of CEE countries taking into account the perspectives of CEE countries to enter the euro area. The aim of this quantitative empirical research is twofold: first, it investigates the weak form of market efficiency for the period from 2nd of September 2005 to 31st of August 2011 by using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller and Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin unit root procedures. Second, it checks the existence of linear correlation between CEE countries and Western European markets. The results assume that the stock markets of some CEE countries follow a unit root. The linear regression model evidences different correlation patterns between CEE and EU old capital markets. Those findings can be used for deeper investigation of market efficiency by highlighting convergence processes of CEE countries with EU old member states. Also effective capital allocation channels, institutional foundations of markets and strengthening of corporate governance should be highlighted. Finally, the outcomes of my paper will be useful for researchers in the field of finance.",

We develop the information processing hypothesis of return volatility to investigate the relation between firm-specific news and volatility. We propose a novel dynamic econometric specification and test it using time series regressions employing a machine learning model selection procedure. Our empirical results are based on a comprehensive dataset comprised of more than 3 million news items for a sample of 28 large U.S. companies. Our proposed econometric specification for firm-specific return volatility is a simple mixture model with two components: public information and private processing of public information. The public information processing component is defined by the contemporaneous relation with public information and volatility, while the private processing of public information component is specified as a general autoregressive process corresponding to the sequential price discovery mechanism of investors as additional information, previously not publicly available, is generated and incorporated into prices. Our results show that changes in return volatility are related to public information arrival and that including indicators of public information arrival explains on average 26% (9\u00e2\u0080\u009365%) of changes in firm-specific return volatility.",

We categorize each stock return as belonging to one of three beta process models, a joint, an idiosyncratic, and a market model based on the role of market shocks and idiosyncratic shocks. Our conclusions differ from those of Brown, Nelson, and Sunnier (1995) who worked with monthly aggregated data in a bivariate EGARCH model. We believe that stock price aggregation in this previous research resulted in a loss of cross sectional variation and consequently lead to weak results. If the asymmetric effect is more readily apparent in daily data, then this may again explain previous researchers' inability to detect asymmetric effects. Our findings shed light on the controversy as to whether abnormalities in stock returns result from overreaction to information or from changes in expected returns in an efficient market. Finding an asymmetric effect in betas leads us to conclude that abnormalities can, at least partially, be explained by changes in expected returns through a change in beta.",

Moreover, the study tries to provide an answer to the question of whether the time of awaiting for a game premiere after its setting or postponement is related to stock prices. In order to collect and select the most numerous sample, an analysis of current reports of all fourteen video game companies listed on WSE Main Market and NewConnect Market in the period from January 4th, 2010 to July 31st, 2017 was carried out. The conducted study allowed for stating that the occurrence of the two event types mentioned does not have a statistically significant impact on stock rates of return. Only in the case of events classified as postponement of a video game premiere could a relation between the rate of return and the period of postponement be spotted. Such a relation is reflected as increased losses along with the postponement period extension.",

We apply dependence-switching copula approach, which allows for a state-varying dependence among markets under different market regimes (bear-bear, bear-bull, bull-bear, and bull-bull regime states). The results show that the U.S Islamic stock market serves as a hedge and a safe haven against oil price movements while its conventional counterparts acts only as a hedge. Morever, the tail dependence between the Islamic stock and oil markets is the lowest when a bullish Islamic stock market coexists with a bearish oil market. Furthermore, the dependence between the conventional stock and oil markets is smallest when a bear conventional market is associated with a bull oil market. Investor minimizes the systemic risk when he holds a short position in the oil market and a long position in the Islamic market, and who with long position in the oil market and a short position in the conventional stock market.",

Using Barun\u00c3\u00adk and K\u00c5\u0099ehl\u00c3\u00adk's (2018) methodology, we find evidence of time-varying volatility spillovers, which are intensified under major events. Moreover, the total volatility spillovers are higher in the short term than both the intermediate and long terms. A portfolio management analysis reveals that a mixed portfolio (commodity and stock markets) provides a higher level of hedging effectiveness for both emerging and developed markets. In addition, the hedging effectiveness in BRICS markets is more pronounced than in developed markets irrespective of frequencies. The hedging effectiveness is also higher using gold than oil and under the short term rather than both the intermediate and long terms. These results provide important implications for risk management and funds allocation.",

The dependence is higher in the long term than in the short and intermediate terms in bearish markets than that for bullish markets. The return spillover is higher during bearish market conditions than during bullish ones.

This study investigates the connectedness between the S&P 500 and various energy sectors, including the Green Bond (Green Bond), S&P GSCI Carbon Emission Allowances Index (GSCI EUA), S&P GSCI Biofuel (GSCI Biofuel), and S&P Global Clean Energy Indices (Global Clean Energy). Combining the quantile connectedness approach of Ando et al. (2022) and the spillover index developed by Chatziantoniou et al. (2022), we investigate the quantile time-frequency connectedness among these markets. Our findings reveal that the impact of tail risk spreading to the energy sector during extremely challenging market conditions is significantly amplified. Most tail risk spillovers between the energy sectors involve short-term risk spillovers, as seen by analyzing the frequency domain. The impact of tail risk spillover is stronger during extreme situations, showing a short-term asymmetry. Global Clean Energy and the S&P 500 play important roles in spreading risk to other sectors, known as tail risk spillover. They add to the overall risk that affects the network system. On the other hand, other energy sectors (GSCI EUA and GSCI Biofuel) as well as green bonds act as net recipients by receiving the risk rather than spreading it further, potentially providing portfolio diversification. It is essential to understand how these key players influence risk in the financial system. Utilizing a variety of techniques to assess portfolio performance shows the importance of understanding the return transmission mechanism in the process of developing a portfolio and suggests that Clean Energy, given its relative independence, may make an excellent diversification investment.",

Using various methodologies, we found that IPOs in our sample performed poorly relative to the comparison portfolios over the 1991\u00e2\u0080\u00932005 horizon in contrast to that reported by prior studies of the French market. This abnormal long-run performance is more severe for orphan IPOs (those without financial analysts\u00e2\u0080\u0099 recommendations) than for non-orphan IPOs the first year following the offerings (a statistically significant difference). In contrast to the widely held belief, this evidence suggests that analyst coverage is indeed not important to the issuing firm. Investors pay more attention to non-orphan IPOs when they are not book built, venture capital backed, underwritten by a large syndicate and less underpriced. Over the 1991\u00e2\u0080\u00932005 period, an analyst\u00e2\u0080\u0099s affiliation does not appear to matter. This result is inconsistent with the conflict of interest hypothesis. During the first year of issuance, analysts\u00e2\u0080\u0099 recommendations are associated with the success of a newly public firm. However, once we extend the horizon to 3 or 5 years after the issuance, we can find that analysts\u00e2\u0080\u0099 recommendations are not significantly related to the long-run performance of IPOs.",

Our empirical strategy is general, and allows the EMRS to vary arbitrarily over time. A novel feature of our technique is that it relies upon exploiting idiosyncratic risk, since theory dictates that idiosyncratic shocks earn the EMRS. We apply our methodology to two different data sets: monthly data from 1994 through 2003, and daily data for 2003. Both data sets include assets from three different markets: the New York Stock Exchange, the NASDAQ, and the Toronto Stock Exchange. For both monthly and daily frequencies, we find plausible estimates of EMRS with considerable precision and time-series volatility. We then use these estimates to test for asset integration, both within and between stock markets. We find that all three markets seem to be internally integrated in the sense that different assets traded on a given market share the same EMRS. The technique is also powerful enough to reject integration between the three stock markets, and between stock and money markets.",

We find patterns in abnormal returns in the days around a director's trade that are consistent with directors engaging in short- term market timing: they sell (buy) after an increase (decline) in prices, and their trades are followed by a partial price reversal. This provides strong evidence that directors trade to exploit patterns in share prices. We also find positive gross, but not net, abnormal returns to imitating some of the trades of directors once transactions costs implicit in the bid-ask spread are taken into account. We also report that some types of trades have superior predictive content over future returns.

        "abstract": "This Paper develops a simple but general methodology to estimate the expected intertemporal marginal rate of substitution or ?EMRS?, using only data on asset prices and returns. Our empirical strategy is general, and allows the EMRS to vary arbitrarily over time. A novel feature of our technique is that it relies upon exploiting idiosyncratic risk, since theory dictates that idiosyncratic shocks earn the EMRS. We apply our methodology to two different datasets: monthly data from 1994 through 2003, and daily data for 2003. Both datasets include assets from three different markets: the New York Stock Exchange, the NASDAQ, and the Toronto Stock Exchange. For both monthly and daily frequencies, we find plausible estimates of EMRS with considerable precision and time-series volatility. We then use these estimates to test for asset integration, both within and between stock markets. We find that all three markets seem to be internally integrated in the sense that different assets traded on a given market share the same EMRS. The technique is also powerful enough to reject integration between the three stock markets, and between stock and money markets.",

        "abstract": "This paper investigates the presence of abnormal returns through the use of trading strategies that exploit the predictability of short run stock price movements. Based on historical returns of the largest set of individual securities in the UK stock market examined to date, this paper identifies profitable momentum trading strategies as investment tools over the period 1955-96. Our results show that returns on trading strategies cannot be accounted for by a simple adjustment for beta-risk. Also, although we find some evidence of a size effect in the UK stock market, this phenomenon cannot explain the momentum profits. The paper finds that these profitable investment strategies are apparent in the sub-sample 1977-96, in line with Liu, Strong and Xu (1999). However, they are not present in the earlier 1955-76 period. The implication is that momentum is not a general feature of the UK stock market, but is only apparent over certain time periods.",

We scrape iPhone rumors from Macrumors.com, and obtain a dataset covering 1,264 articles containing 180 words on average bet-ween January 2002 and December 2015. Moreover, we construct a market-decided lexicon to transform qualitative information into quantitative data, and analyze what type of words and what information embedded in the rumors are apt to impact on Apple's stock price. Unlike previous studies, we do not rely on the widely-adopted Harvard-IV-4 dictionary, as the coefficients of the words from the dictionary are neither significant nor consistent with their polarities, compared with our results. The paper obtains three main findings. First, the spread of rumors has a significant impact on the stock price. Second, positive words, rather than negative words, play an important role in affecting the stock price. Third, the stock price is highly sensitive to the words related to the appearance of the iPhone.",

When net positions are decomposed into expected and unexpected components, we find that expected net positions by type of trader generally do not co-vary with volatility. However, volatility is positively associated with shocks (in either direction) in net positions of speculators and small traders, and negatively related to shocks (in either direction) in net positions of hedgers. This evidence suggests that changes in speculative positions destabilize the market. Consistent with dispersion of beliefs models and noise trading theories, hedgers appear to possess private information, whereas speculators and small traders are less informed in these markets.",

We find that after controlling for market risk factors, speculators are contrarians, but respond positively to market sentiment. In contrast, hedgers engage in positive feedback trading and trade against market sentiment. We also find that trades of speculators (hedgers) are positively (negatively) correlated with subsequent abnormal returns; however, it does not appear that speculators possess superior forecasting power. Therefore, hedging pressure effects likely explain the negative relation between the performance of speculators and hedgers. The positive feedback trading by hedgers together with their negative performance suggests that hedgers have a destabilizing impact on futures prices.",

We demonstrate the significance of these relationships primarily employing a two-way fixed effects panel data regression model covering cross-sectional and time-series observations of US stock trades from May 2018 to July 2020. The findings hold true across various cross-sectional subsamples and across subperiods before and after March 2020, coinciding with the stock market crash induced by heightened risks of the COVID-19 pandemic. With regard to returns, our analysis identifies three co-movement channels: 1) increased correlated trading by retail traders, 2) extended delay in incorporating market-wide information, and 3) a direct effect influenced by the integration of firm-specific information into prices. In contrast, for liquidity co-movement, we fail to identify evidence of plausible channels relating to either volatility or correlated trading. However, it appears that the significant direct effects that we document stem from a broadened array of trading strategies when retail traders contribute to the market. Collectively, these findings have important implications as return co-movement limits investors' ability to diversify investments and manage risks, while liquidity co-movement heightens market vulnerability to crashes.",

Similar to the findings in the U.S., I find significant positive abnormal returns around both the announcement and the execution day of German stock splits. I also observe an increase in return variance and in liquidity after the ex-day. Apparently, legal restrictions strongly limit the ability of German companies to use a stock split for signaling. I find that abnormal returns around the announcement day are consistently much lower in Germany than in the U.S. Further, I find that abnormal returns around the announcement day are not related to changes in liquidity, but (negatively) to firm size, thus lending support to the neglected firm hypothesis. On the methodological side the effect of thin trading on event study results is examined. Using trade-to-trade returns increases the significance of abnormal returns, but the difference between alternative return measurement methods is relatively small in short event periods. Thus, the observed market reaction cannot be attributed to measurement problems caused by thin trading.",

This paper studies trading costs using the sample of portfolio transition trades. The known exogeneity of these trades eliminates the selection bias problem. We estimate a piece-wise linear price impact functions with the intercept corresponding to fixed spread costs and the slope corresponding to variable price impact costs. Buy orders are more expensive than sell orders due to specific institutional features of portfolio transitions. For high-volume stocks, small trades are executed at a discount relative to a piece-wise linear specification. Since the size of this discount is comparable to bid-ask spread, we attribute documented non-linearity to ability of portfolio transition managers sometimes to earn bid-ask spread instead of paying it by providing liquidity to other market participants.",

We use data on one of the most developed financial markets in transition, the Czech Republic, to investigate financial market efficiency by examining the reaction to macroeconomic releases. Direct measure of market expectations, that is, survey data, is used to form a proxy for market expectations. The reactions of interest rates, bond yields, exchange rates, and the stock market index are explored. We found that, despite the fact that the survey data appear to reasonably approximate rational expectations, the Czech market lacks basic efficiency properties. It reacts to the expected part of the news announcement, and the adjustment is stretched over a period of several days. In the case of CPI, we found evidence suggesting that the efficiency of the market improves over time.",

We show that in a standard rational expectations model, return R2 is independent of the amount of information incorporated into stock prices. Furthermore, an alternative model in which stock price fluctuations are driven by investor sentiment leads to an opposite prediction that lower return R2 is associated with stronger medium-term price momentum and long-term price reversal, two commonly believed signs of market inefficiency. By examining stock returns both in the U.S. and internationally, we found empirical evidence consistent with this contrasting prediction. Overall, our analysis casts doubt on the argument that low return R2 is a measure of market efficiency.",

        "abstract": "This paper examines the quantile relationships between the Saudi Riyal (SAR) exchange rate pressure, Credit default swap (CDS) spreads, total reserve assets, and oil prices. Using the available monthly data ranging from 2008 to 2018 and employing the error correction model, the results show a negative and significant relationship between the long-run coefficient of the SAR exchange rate pressure and the long run coefficients of both the CDS and the oil price. However, the long run coefficient of the foreign reserves is statistically insignificant, thus indicating that the exchange rate pressure, CDS spread and oil price variables are cointegrated. As for the short-run coefficients, we find that the lag SAR pressure affects the current pressure. Moreover, the short-run coefficient of the foreign reserves affects negatively the SAR pressure. Moreover, using the quantile ARDL (QARDL) model, we find a significant relationship particularly in the extreme quantiles, regardless of the level or the log level series. Under the long-run coefficients, the positive (negative) relationship characterizes the nexus of the reserves-pressure and the CDS-pressure (oil-pressure) on the SAR. As for the short-run coefficients, we find that an increase in the lag SAR pressures contributes to the current pressure across all quantiles, whereas an increase in the reserves reduces the pressure in the extreme quantiles. These results have important implications for policy makers.",

Return predictability is found to be driven by changing market conditions, consistent with the implication of the adaptive markets hypothesis. During market crashes, no statistically significant return predictability is observed, but return predictability is associated with a high degree of uncertainty. In times of economic or political crises, stock returns have been highly predictable with a moderate degree of uncertainty in predictability. We find that return predictability has been smaller during economic bubbles than in normal times. We also find evidence that return predictability is associated with stock market volatility and economic fundamentals.",

        "abstract": "Tests of the semi-strong form of the efficient market hypothesis (EMH) typically use earnings and book value of equity as benchmarks of fundamental value. Accounting earnings, however, are contaminated by noise due to their transient component and book value of equity tends to be biased downwards due to accounting conservatism. We investigate whether controlling for these effects impacts on the implications concerning the information efficiency of the Swedish stock market. We conclude that relevant adjustments increase both the magnitude and the consistency of the value premium earned on a contrarian investment strategy that buys (shorts) stocks with low (high) relative market valuation. The existence of the value premium cannot be explained by common risk proxies or transaction costs argument. Using cleaner accounting proxies thus strengthens the evidence on the imperfect efficiency of the Swedish stock market.",

We apply the Asymmetric Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (A-MF-DFA) approach to 15-min interval intraday data. The results show strong evidence of asymmetric multifractality that increases as the fractality scale increases. Moreover, multifractality is especially higher in the downside (upside) trend for Brent oil (gold), and this excess asymmetry has been more accentuated during the COVID-19 outbreak. Before the outbreak, the gold (oil) market was more inefficient during downward (upward) trends. During the COVID-19 outbreak period, we see that the results have changed. More precisely, we find that gold (oil) is more inefficient during upward (downward) trends. Gold and oil markets have been inefficient, particularly during the outbreak. The efficiency of gold and oil markets is sensitive to scales, market trends, and to the pandemic outbreak, highlighting the investor sentiment effect.",

        "abstract": "This study investigates the frequency connectedness among foreign exchange markets of G10 countries, focusing on tail risk and its implications for portfolio management. To do so, we use a novel framework that combines the Conditional Autoregressive Value-at-Risk (CAViaR) model with the novel time-varying frequency and quantile connectedness method developed by Chatziantoniou et al. (2022) based on Barun\u00c3\u00adk and K\u00c5\u0099ehl\u00c3\u00adk (2018) and Ando et al. (2018) approach. A key value of this paper to the literature is the provision of fresh empirical evidence on the extreme downside linkages among the markets examined. From the average connectedness measures, the top shock transmitters within the network were EUR, NOK, AUD, SEK, and NZD, while the main shock receivers emerged to be JPY and CHF, followed by CAD and GBP. We note that events in the major funding markets (the Eurozone, Japan) have a higher impact on the participants in these same markets than in relatively small markets (New Zealand, Norway). From the dynamic connectedness results, the magnitude of connectedness for the entire sample period increased during the COVID-19 era, compared to the magnitude before the COVID-19 outbreak. The cumulative spillover also reveals that USDNOK is the vastest net transmitter of spillovers to other markets, including SEK, CHF, and AUD. However, the EUR is the largest net beneficiary followed by JPY and CAD. Findings from the time-varying extreme downside analysis suggest that throughout the period, SEK and NOK are the other currencies' strongest and most frequent net spillover shock emitters for the short-, medium-, and long-term dynamics. Currency portfolio implications are discussed.",

Applying permutation entropy on intraday data that covers between April 30, 2019 and May 13, 2020, we show that efficiency of all sample asset classes is deteriorated with the outbreak, and in most cases this deterioration is significant. Results are found to be robust under different analysis schemes. Brent oil is the highest efficient market before and during crisis. The degree of efficiency is heterogeneous among all markets. The analysis by an asymmetric multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (A-MF-DFA) approach shows evidence of asymmetric multifractality in all markets which rise with the scales. The inefficiency is higher during downward trends before the pandemic crisis as well as during COVID-19 except for gold and Bitcoin. Moreover, the pandemic intensifies the inefficiency of all markets except Bitcoin.

We draw our empirical results using the index methods of Diebold and Yilmaz (2012, 2014) and Barun\u00c3\u00adk and K\u00c5\u0099ehl\u00c3\u00adk (2018). The results show that the precious metals, except for gold, have the largest spillovers on the Australian dollar and Canadian dollar and receive the largest spillovers from these currencies for all the time horizons. In addition, with the exception of gold, the smallest spillovers from the precious metals are exerted on the Japanese yen and Chinese yuan and these currencies have the smallest spillovers to the precious metals. The Japanese yen and Chinese yuan act primarily as spillover receivers, whereas the other currencies act as both spillover transmitters and receivers in different time periods. The spillovers for most of the pairs are asymmetric for all the time horizons, are more pronounced in the short term, and noticeably increase during times of financial and economic uncertainty. Finally, adding precious metal futures contracts to currency portfolios provides diversification and hedging advantages, with hedging effectiveness higher in the short term than in the intermediate and long terms.",

This study examines market efficiency and dynamic speculation in major European natural gas hubs (the Zeebrugge (ZEE) hub of Belgium, Title Transfer Facility (TTF) hub of the Netherlands, and National Balancing Point (NBP) hub of the UK) during the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia-Ukraine conflict. Using the Asymmetric multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (A-MFDFA) and the power law exponent (PLE) approach, we show that European natural gas markets exhibit an asymmetric multifractal behavior and long-memory effects, with variations observed during crises. The ZEE hub in Belgium and the NBP hub in the UK demonstrate a higher multifractality under different trends during the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine conflict, respectively. Notably, the TTF hub in the Netherlands emerges as the most efficient market during all subperiods. Moreover, our results, using the PLE approach, suggest that European gas market inefficiencies during crises can be attributed to speculative strategies that create self-perpetuating dynamics and diminish market transparency, leading to heightened risk and volatility in gas prices. Our findings underscore the need for regulatory intervention to mitigate excessive speculation and enhance transparency in gas markets. Diversifying gas supplies and fortifying European gas hubs emerge as pivotal strategies to bolster resilience and stability during crises.",

        "abstract": "This paper provides an extensive empirical investigation into the sources of index return autocorrelation, focusing on the relation between autocorrelation in individual stock returns and autocorrelation in index returns. The study uses daily data from the Stockholm Stock Exchange over the period 1980-1995 and reports three main empirical findings. Daily Swedish stock index returns exhibit strong, and consistently positive, first order autocorrelation throughout the sample period. Positive autocorrelation is observed for return frequencies between 1 day and 3 months. The most liquid stocks exhibit strong positive return autocorrelation. Less liquid stocks exhibit weak or negative return autocorrelation. Autocorrelation is asymmetric, high after days of above average performance of the stock market, low after days of below average performance. When compared to the other days of the week, both index returns and individual stock returns exhibit the strongest autocorrelation following on Friday returns. The transaction cost hypothesis was tested using the Swedish stock market transaction tax. Results indicate lower precision of stock prices during the transaction tax period, but no direct effect on return autocorrelation. The paper concludes that at least three sources contribute to observed return autocorrelation. For daily and short-term returns, profit taking and nonsynchronous trading are the probable causes of observed autocorrelation. For monthly and longer term returns, time-varying expected returns best describe the empirical results.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces and analyses a model of cross-security information aggregation in a rational expectations equilibrium (REE). The model predicts a well-defined lead-lag structure between securities returns as a result of Bayesian information extraction from realised securities prices. Both leads and lags will be strongest between securities with highly correlated return processes, but only weakly correlated return innovations. Securities whose prices reveal highly precise signals will tend to lead other securities. The model has important implications for empirical testing of lead-lag effects between financial markets and instruments. As an application of the model, it is demonstrated that stock option returns will tend to lag the corresponding stock prices. Direct empirical tests of the lead-lag effects between individual stocks on the Paris Bourse provided strong support for the model. In addition to confirming the predicted pattern of leads and lags, the paper demonstrates that the cross-security correlation is higher for short-term returns than for long-term returns for about a third of securities pairs traded on the Paris Bourse. This result is interpreted as strong cross-security correlation of revealed information, which gives the model strong support over alternative specifications of multi-asset securities markets, such as the nonsynchronous trading hypothesis or the Chan (1993) model.",

We find patterns in abnormal returns in the days around a director's trade that are consistent with directors engaging in short-term market timing: they sell (buy) after an increase (decline) in prices, and their trades are followed by a partial price reversal. This provides strong evidence that directors trade to exploit patterns in share prices. We also find positive gross, but not net, abnormal returns to imitating some of the trades of directors once transactions costs implicit in the bid-ask spread are taken into account. We also report that some types of trades have superior predictive content over future returns. In particular, we find that medium-sized trades are more informative for short-term returns than large ones, consistent with Barclay and Warner's (1993) \"stealth trading\" hypothesis",

Por \u00c2\u00a3ltimo, se detecta una reacci\u00c2\u00a2n mucho mayor en el mercado brit nico en las fechas inmediatamente posteriores a las operaciones de compra de los insiders, lo cual podr\u00c2\u00a1a apoyar las tesis de Manne (1966) sobre la mayor rapidez en la incorporaci\u00c2\u00a2n de la informaci\u00c2\u00a2n a los precios a trav\u00e2\u0080\u009as de las operaciones de insiders. The investigation of the returns associated to corporate insiders transactions is an outstanding topic nowadays due to its implications on both academia research (due to its influence on market efficiency) and political issues (lack of effectiveness of insider trading regulation). The current paper attempts to analyse insiders? behaviour in two European stock markets, located in the same geographical area but characterised by different legal environments, such as UK and Spain. By using the event studies methodology, we simultaneously study insider trading profitability in both markets in the short term. By applying Dodd and Warner?s (1983) standardised test, we detect that insiders in both countries obtained abnormal returns in both their sales and purchases, although purchases seem to have a bigger information content, supporting wide previous literature. Finally, we may highlight that the higher market reaction detected in the Uk market for purchases in the post-event period seems to corroborate Manne\u00c3\u00afs (1966) thesis on the positive effects of insider trading which enables stock prices to rapidly impound insiders? information.",

The revocation of the uptick rule provides us with a unique setting to investigate the impact of short-sale constraints on various short-selling strategies in a controlled environment. Comparing short-selling behaviors for uptick-rule restricted and unrestricted stocks during the pre- and post-revocation periods, we find that contrarian short selling and voluntary-liquidity short selling are more profound in uptick-rule-restricted stocks than in unrestricted stock and that market trend chasing short selling is less profound in uptick-rule-restricted stocks than in unrestricted stocks. Our results also show that the uptick rule has no impact on risk-bearing short-selling strategies.",

The magnitude of the return predictability of the variance risk premium easily dominates that afforded by standard predictor variables like the P/E ratio, the dividend yield, the default spread, and the consumption-wealth ratio (CAY). Moreover, combining the variance risk premium with the P/E ratio results in an R2 for the quarterly returns of more than twenty-five percent.

We examine the case of Ireland. Ireland is an interesting case because its people are passionate about sport, the domestic population is relatively homogenous (rather than divided) in terms of support for Irish competitors in international competition and domestic investors comprise a large proportion of owners of Irish stocks\u00e2\u0080\u0094all factors which suggest that if a mood effect exists it should show up in this case. Generally, we do not find a strong link between sport results and stock market returns. Initial results do suggest that in events of particularly high importance, such as the knock-out stages of major competitions, losses are associated with negative returns. However, on controlling for indirect economic effects of sporting wins and losses such as on tourism and travel we find the mood effect is no longer significant.",

For the stock markets from East Europe the results are in line with the symmetric volatility, i.e. volatility is similar affected by both positive and negative returns with the same magnitude. For the stock markets from Central Europe the results are consistent with the leverage hypothesis of the asymmetric volatility, i.e. negative and positive returns with the same magnitude have different impact on volatility. Furthermore the volatility is more sensitive to its lagged values in the market place than it is to new information.

The current study uses correlation and multiple regression analysis to analyse the implications of pertinent financial indicators in the process of making investment decisions, specifically their impact on the stock market performance of securities traded on the Bucharest Stock Exchange. A sample of Romanian businesses operating in the sales, services, and industrial sectors for nine fiscal years has been included in the study. The findings indicate that the stock return and price-to-book ratio (PBR) are not significantly impacted by ROE, turnover increase, or auditor reputation (Big 4, Non-Big 4). However, the implications of leverage, industry sector, and company size are significant in relation to the evolution of PBR, and in the case of stock returns, the asset structure shows considerable predictive power. Consequently, even though a company s financial performance serves as the main benchmark for stock market investments, the evolution of other variables, such as financial leverage and firm size, has a greater impact on the sample of Romanian firms under analysis when it comes to determining the variation in the performance of stocks. This highlights the fact that an overall analysis of the economic situation and reported accounting information is necessary to determine the efficiency of investing capital in financial instruments.",

The empirical results show the determining influence of DJIA concerning the dynamic of the other studied indexes, especially in a period of crisis. Established are statistical evidences for rejecting the EMH assumptions concerning the Bulgarian capital market. The presence and direction of impact on it by the studied developed capital markets are clearly outlined. This impact is significant only in a period of crisis and shows the determining influence of DJIA to DAX concerning SOFIX. An econometric modeling concerning return and variability of the studied indexes is made through EGARCH models using Student-t distribution. There is an increase of the descriptive power of the applied models concerning return and variability of SOFIX when including data from DJIA. The analysis of the indicators information efficiency and asymmetry concerning the Bulgarian index shows the faster and bigger inclusion of negative information in the values of the index. The differences in presenting the market information and the determining influence of DJIA by DAX and SOFIX are clearly outlined. Such difference is present also concerning the manifestation of the so-called leverage effect. The study determines in percentage the influence of the information of the USA index on the variability of the Bulgarian one. The achieved results from this study reject the EMH assumptions and the suggestion of random wandering of the studied indexes, as well as the statement of a weak correlation between the developed and developing capital markets, especially in a period of a crisis.",

consequences of international events on the daily dynamics of the stock market. An event study methodology is applied to examine the main and sector stock markets reaction to the host selection announcement and event beginning dates hypothesized to be positive, as well as the event ending impact expected to be negative. Results indicate positive significant EURO championships announcement effect, positive travel & leisure, construction and telecommunication sectors performance; however negative effect is exerted by Summer Olympics and FIFA World Cup (WCF) announcements. Event beginning positive effect is supported by EURO and the Winter Olympics induced construction sector index performance. Negative event end impact is validated by Summer Olympics, however positive effect is evidenced around EURO, WCC hypothesized to be influenced by the \u00e2\u0080\u009cwinner\u00e2\u0080\u009d impact. Stock markets reaction might be conditional upon investors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 perception of the bidding results likelihood and investor sentiment arguments. Through the evaluation of equity markets reaction to international events the study also underlines the importance for respective authorities to examine equity markets trends in response to the monetary policy decisions announcement as the gauge of market sentiments and forward expectations of economic benefits and stability in relation to particular decisions.",

It is found that the day of the announcement, per se, has little impact on jump intensities. Employment releases are an exception. However, when macroeconomic surprises are considered, inflation shocks show persistent effects while monetary policy and employment shocks show only short-lived effects. Also, the jump intensity responds asymmetrically to macroeconomic shocks. Evidence that macroeconomic variables are relevant to explain jump dynamics and improve volatility forecasts on event days is provided.",

        "abstract": "Purpose. The purpose of this article is the research of correctness of CAPM-model application in the Ukrainian stock market and the analysis of the time factor's influence on the results of this model application. This problem acquires a special relevance for the provision of the investors' financial security, who act in the conditions of significant uncertainty and high risk of the Ukrainian stock market. Methodology. In this work, methods of dynamic lines' analysis, statistical, structural, comparative, correlation-regressive analysis were used. As the initial data during the research of profitability of the Ukrainian enterprises' shares, the data of the exchanging prices of the Ukrainian emitters' securities, according to the results of the trades in the Public JSC \"Ukrainian Exchange\", were used. Results. Contemporary approaches to the CAPM-model application in the markets, which are being developed, were analysed. As the result of this analysis, it was revealed that most of the scientific researches in this area emphasize incorrectness and unreliability of the results as to the prediction of the profitability indexes on such markets. Calculation of the \u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00b2-coefficient for the Ukrainian emitters' securities for the various investments' horizon periods was done. The results of the calculation showed that the value of the \u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00b2-coefficient varies greatly onthe terms of investment and is not of the strictly consistent pattern. Stock market profitability per month based on UX-index and considering the investment horizon period was calculated. The expected profitability of the Ukrainian emitters' securities was distinguished and compared to their real rate of returns. During the profitability analysis in the investment intervals, exponential moving average with its further shift for a month was used. It gave an opportunity to distinguish an average monthly profitability in the various investment horizon periods (1 till 12 months). Practical significance. The application of the suggested approach can become an additional technique for the estimation of the investment attractiveness of securities of the stock market emitters in the various investment horizon periods that, in its turn, will increase the safety of such investment. Conclusions. The conclusion was made as to the correctness of the CAPM-model application in the Ukrainian reality, according to which it is almost impossible to define the exact regularity of the behaviour of indexes of the expected and real profitability depending on the investment horizon period. It casts doubt on the possibility of the appropriate and correct application of the CAPMmodel in the Ukrainian stock market. This conclusion, in general, coincides with the conclusions of many scientists, who conducted similar researches in the stock markets of other developing countries.",

The analysis distinguishes between five periods from January to May 2020, namely the pre-incubation, incubation, outbreak, lockdown, and lockdown lift periods. The study provides evidence that industry-level stock returns witnessed their largest drop during the outbreak period. In particular, the travel and leisure, construction, telecommunications, industrial goods, real estate, technology and utility sectors had, on average, highly negative cumulative returns. The results also reveal a partial recovery in equity prices during the lockdown period, possibly due to the announcement of fiscal stimulus measures by the Greek government, along with the initiation of the ECB\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP). The telecommunications, construction, technology, and travel and leisure sectors exhibited the highest performance over that period. The study also evaluates the reaction of industry-level stock returns relative to the market index, performing an event study analysis. The empirical findings show that the utilities, telecommunications, personal goods and retail sectors experienced fewer losses compared with the market index during the outbreak period in Greece. Finally, despite the partial recovery of equity prices in the lockdown period, the results show that the basic raw materials, food and beverage, industrial goods and retail sectors underperformed compared with the market index in the short run.",

We combine investor behavioral traits and option-implied standard deviations under both the real-world probabaility valued most in the view of the uninformed investors and the risk-neutral space adopted when there exists no cognitive error. Given that investor sentiment can be thought of as risk taking by the uniformed exceeding their informed peers, we postulate that the differences between variance, skewness and kurtosis mesures for investors with various behavioral traits.We hence construct our investor sentiment proxy by summing these differentials of variance, skewness and kurtosis in weighted forms. It is documented that such relative investor sentiment metric exhibits economically and statistically strong return predictability for momentum porfolios. Our findings contribute to the extant literature by 1) complementing the Baker-Wurgler market-based investor sentiment index from a theoretical perspective 2) modelling investor sentiment via utilizing the informational content of options prices and 3) supporting the Barberis-Schleifer-Vishny definition of investor sentiment to be differences in financial market participant behavior.",

We prove that the speculative term must be orthogonal to public information in real time and therefore statistically distinct from risk premia. Empirically, the speculative component is quantitatively important, accounting for up to one percentage point of US yields. Furthermore, estimates of historical risk premia from the heterogeneous information model are less volatile than, and negatively correlated with, risk premia estimated using a standard Affine Gaussian Term Structure model.",

The magnitude of the deviation and the speed of convergence are found to depend both on the proportion of each type of traders in the market and on the memory length of \u00e2\u0080\u0098chartists\u00e2\u0080\u0099.

Using the CBOE VIX and its innovation on the concurrent spot volatility as proxies for expected volatility, we present evidence of an increase in S&P 500 index futures mispricing with expected volatility. The impact of the VIX grows exponentially across the distribution of conditional mispricing levels, which suggests that the expectations of heightened future volatility become increasingly detrimental to arbitrage activities when the futures price deviations are enlarged; however, the influence of expected volatility is found to have been reduced during the global financial crisis period, a period during which concurrent volatility overwhelmingly dominated the magnitude of mispricing.",

Unlike previous studies, by comparing pairs of securities as their relative liquidity varies over time, we can disregard any cross-sectional differences between the securities. Also, since the liquidity of Treasury notes varies predictably over time we are able to distinguish between current liquidity and expected future liquidity. We show that the more liquid security is priced higher on average, but that this difference depends on the amount of expected future liquidity over its remaining lifetime rather than its current liquidity. We measure future liquidity using both quotes and trades. The liquidity measures include bid-ask spread, depth and trading activity. Examining a variety of liquidity measures enables us to evaluate their relative importance and to identify the liquidity proxies that most affect prices. Although all the measures are highly correlated with one another, we find that quoted bid-ask spread and quoted depth are more important than effective spread and trade size, respectively. Among measures of market activity, however, the number of trades and volume are more related to the liquidity premium than the number of quotes.",

We validate our music-based sentiment measure by correlating it with mood swings induced by seasonal factors and weather conditions. We find that music sentiment is positively correlated with same-week market returns and negatively correlated with next-week returns, consistent with sentiment-induced temporary mispricing. Results also hold under a daily analysis and are stronger when short-sale constraints limit arbitrage. Music sentiment also predicts increases in net mutual fund flows, and absolute sentiment precedes a rise in stock market volatility.",

In particular, we analyze how specific announcements related to vulnerable eurozone member states, European Central Bank (ECB) actions, and credit rating downgrades affect the value and the crash risk of the euro. We proxy the appreciation and depreciation of the euro by its abnormal foreign exchange (FX) rate returns with respect to 35 currencies. The crash risk of the euro is proxied by the conditional skewness of the FX rate return distribution with respect to the same currencies. We find that the market reacts positively to news related to countries under EU/IMF rescue umbrella. We discover that ECB actions on average result in a euro depreciation on the day of the announcement reflecting obvious concerns of market participants, but the effect is partly reversed the day after. Our analysis also shows that sovereign and corporate credit rating downgrades tend to lead to a depreciation of the euro and, more importantly, to an increase of the euro crash risk. Interestingly, we find that specific announcements about Greece on average do not substantially affect the euro exchange rate directly; however, it does have an overall significant effect on the euro crash risk, imposing a substantial risk for the stability of the common currency in the eurozone.",

The model allows the testing of dynamic cross-autocorrelation effects, while controlling for own time-varying autoregressive coefficients. Using daily and weekly data from 1965 to 2015, a constant cross-autocorrelation pattern is rejected. Returns on a large-firm portfolio are found to lead returns on a small-firm portfolio. The lead-lag relation changes over time with the variance of the large-firm returns. Traditional vector autoregressions with constant cross-autoregressive coefficients appear to be overly restrictive when testing lead-lag relations in stock markets.",

We postulate that the perceived negative IVOL-expected return relation could be the artifact of the confounding effect of public news arrivals. Using the stock return data from the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) database and the news database from the RavenPack News Analytics over the period from 2000 to 2011, we show that the strength of the positive relation is reduced systematically by 50% after accounting for the arrivals of good and bad news releases, which are defined by their sentiment scores. This finding is robust to numerous model specifications, and the inclusion of firm-level characteristics, liquidity risk and information risk. When we restrict the firm-specific news to value-relevant news, the positive relation disappears. We conclude that that the public arrivals of firm-specific news play a significant role in explaining the IVOL puzzle.",

Legacy futures volume has trended downward while other series have trended upward. Total futures volume has increased, suggesting that the trading in the legacy contract has been at least partially supplanted by trading in the E-mini contract. All series are highly cross-correlated and jointly dependent. Signed and absolute trading activity in contingent claims (most prominently, options) predicts shifts in aggregate state variables such as the short interest rate, and the term and credit spreads, as well as signed and absolute returns around major macroeconomic announcements. Overall, consistent with the informational role of options, their volume innovations have the strongest forecasting ability for fluctuations in the macroeconomic environment.",

The positive relationship between aggregate credit risk and expected stock market returns accords with the risk-return tradeoff theory.

First, we find that as short sellers become more active, stock price adjustments accelerate, and prices respond more swiftly to public information. Second, we investigate the trading behavior of short sellers during periods of extreme stock price fluctuations and reversals. Our empirical findings suggest that short sellers behave like contrarian traders during these periods and consequently, short sales reduce the stock price crash risk. Last, we find that in emerging markets dominated by individual investors, sentiment seems a key factor for short sellers to moderate market crashes. When the market experiences unexpected sudden plunges, short sellers become \u00e2\u0080\u009csupport buyers\u00e2\u0080\u009d and reverse the previously bullish investor-dominated market sentiment, thus correcting mispricing and mitigating irrationality.",

However, few studies have examined the relationship between the two markets. Based on multivariate generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity models, we investigate the volatility spillovers and dynamic correlations between China's new energy and stock markets using daily data from 2009 to 2023. And we also explore how these dimensions changed during the financial crisis in 2015 and the COVID-19 period. Our findings indicate that there are bidirectional volatility spillovers and asymmetric effects between these markets, suggesting that risks can accumulate and negative shocks may have greater impacts than positive ones. These findings are still robust after changing the distribution of the error term and excluding the impact of COVID-19. Significantly, volatility spillovers between markets increased and asymmetric effects disappeared during the two events due to the extreme turbulence in the stock market. Additionally, we find that the two markets exhibit high interdependence, implying the existence of risk synergy effects and limited possibilities for portfolio diversification. Finally, our analysis of the marginal expected shortfall indicates that losses in China's new energy market increased during the financial crisis in 2015, implying that this strategic market is more exposed to the negative shocks of the stock market. These results are valuable to policymakers, investors, and companies involved in China's new energy market.",

By strategically deciding trading-section transfer when it is beneficial, managers expect to reduce their liquidity and invisibility costs, cost of capital, or their listing costs. We show that managers decide to change the trading compartment of their common stocks based on various factors including firm's size, liquidity level, debt ratio, and expected growth opportunities. Firms that move voluntarily from a less or non regulated compartments to a more regulated one are likely to have transferred to increase their credibility, improve their stocks\u00e2\u0080\u0099 liquidity, re-balance their leverage, and to finance their growth opportunities. Whereas those that move their common stocks toward a less-regulated compartments do it mainly for costs saving reasons.",

Additionally, we find that firms with fewer institutional investors, financial analysts, and smaller sizes are more susceptible to market under-reaction.

For index additions, we find an inverse relationship in the reconstitution period, suggesting a dominant price pressure effect, and a direct relationship post-reconstitution, suggesting that short interest liquidity benefits dominate. For index deletions, our evidence suggests there are permanent negative wealth effects and persistent increases in short interest surrounding index reconstitutions, consistent with the imperfect substitutes hypothesis. Overall, our results show that short interest is an influential factor in the wealth effects of Russell 2000 index reconstitutions.",

We document that the fundamentals of Australian firms are correlated along supply chain. Further, the lagged returns of customers predict the one-month future returns of focal firms, implying that information embedded in trade links is not fully incorporated in stock prices. A long-short portfolio that buys (short-sells) stocks with high (low) lagged customer returns yields 0.8% monthly abnormal return on average. The predictive power of customer returns is weakened among large firms, firms with a greater number of informed market participants and a higher level of investor attention, and dissipates as the holding period lengthens. This provides strong support for the gradual-information-diffusion hypothesis.",

However, whether past market information embedded in market memory influences investor herding has been less explored. We utilize tick-level trading data from the Chinese stock market to examine the impact of the market memory formed of stocks' exceptional performance during their initial trading days on the future herding behavior of retail investors. The empirical results show that the market memory of newly listed stocks is positively correlated with retail investor herding one year later at the appearance of a market-wide upward trend. We also propose an advance reaction channel in which retail investors tend to pay early attention to and preemptively invest in stocks with deep market memory due to their limited attention and the availability heuristic, leading to further herding due to confirmation bias. Our findings show that market information, if not fully incorporated into current stock prices through investor trading, can be partly stored in market memory. When activated by specific market conditions, market memory can be recalled and affect investor behavior and subsequent price dynamics. Our findings provide additional evidence to challenge the efficient market hypothesis (EMH) from the perspective of behavioral finance.",

Our trading strategy exploits both the pre- and the post-announcement drift of implied volatilities and generates a sizable trading profit of 11.4% per ELW contract in excess of transaction costs during the 21 business days around the earnings announcement date. In particular, short-term deep out-of-the-money ELWs deliver a 26.0% trading profit per ELW contract.

These stocks represent the principal equity investment universe for institutional investors and managed funds due to their sufficient size and liquidity which make the momentum trading strategies practical and implementable. By incorporating the short-selling ban during the global financial crisis, we find evidence of return persistence.

Our results are consistent with previous empirical evidence that documents strong investor behavioural biases in valuing extremely uncertain stocks or hard-to-value stocks (Kumar, 2009).

Among them, seven news categories can be identified as conveying a positive or negative tone and the remaining three are news announcements.

Different types of investors have different responses to the tone of media coverage. The trading behavior of foreign institutional investors is consistent with the tone of media coverage.

We find a positive relationship between search intensity and stock returns and between search intensity and liquidity. The positive correlation between search intensity and stock returns/liquidity tends to be larger for startup firms with a high proportion of individual shareholders. Contrary to prior studies that have reported a reversal after an immediate stock price increase, our results show the possibility that an immediate increase in stock returns of startup firms may not be neutralized in the long run.",

We find that media sentiment influences institutional traders to overreact to earnings news measured by analyst forecast errors. In contrast, retail traders are indifferent to either positive or negative unexpected earnings in the presence of media sentiment. Further analysis reveals that their trading decisions are affected by media sentiment alone, independent of the earnings surprise. We also find that firm-specific media sentiment complements market-wide sentiment by providing timelier information to investors in shaping their perceptions of unexpected earnings in the Australian market.",

Investors interpret impact of earnings news based on a stock's nearness to 52-week high, and hence underreact to positive earnings news if the stock price is near its peak. We find that among positive earnings stocks, PEAD is pronounced when they are near 52-week highs. Furthermore, excessive optimism in analyst forecasts is larger among stocks far from 52-week highs. Lastly, individual investors' buying pressure around earnings announcement is concentrated on stocks far from 52-week highs.",

We find that the distress puzzle observed for overpriced stocks, not for underpriced stocks, becomes insignificant after adjustment for short sale constraints due to an asymmetric pricing effect of short sale constraints only on the short-leg side of distress. However, after adjustment for arbitrage risk, the distress puzzle remains unchanged. These results indicate that the distress puzzle is mainly attributable to short sale constraints, rather than other limits-to-arbitrages such as arbitrage risk, which has a bi-lateral pricing effect on both short-leg and long-leg sides of distress. To mitigate a possible endogeneity problem relation among financial distress, mispricing, and short sale constraints, we measure these variables with different timing.",

Specifically, investors exhibit optimistic responses to good news about companies with higher ESG scores but pessimistic responses to bad news about companies with lower ESG scores.

We show that disagreement commonality can be a new measure of firm-specific information centering on analysts. We find a positive relationship between firms' commonality in disagreement and co-movement in their stock returns. A higher disagreement commonality may indicate lower usefulness of firm-specific information that strengthens the synchronicity between a firm's stock return and the market return.

The CS effect is more pronounced among stocks with greater costly arbitrage and greater lottery preference.

The empirical evidence indicates that firms with high profit instability have substantially lower future stock returns than those with low profit instability. The predictive information contained in profit instability is not subsumed by the level of profitability or the volatility of cash flow and is robust after controlling for well-known firm characteristics and risks. In addition, the long-term predictive performance of the firm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s profit instability is permanent over at least five years. Moreover, the profit instability effect is stronger among firms with better recent past performance, more lottery-like payoffs, and higher arbitrage risk. This finding suggests that the immaturity of investors and high constraints on arbitrage are the main sources of the profit instability effect in the Chinese market, which is consistent with the implications of behavioral mispricing explanations. Our investigation enriches the studies on profitability anomalies by uncovering profit instability as an incremental signal in predicting stock returns. Furthermore, this study provides a novel view to better understand the mechanisms of the anomalies related with firms' profitability in undeveloped stock markets of emerging economies, thereby benefiting investors from all over the world to seek more efficient investment strategies.",

I confirm that positive shocks to U.S. production of oil and economic activity have a significant and positive influence on stock returns. Moreover, the negative and persistent effect of real oil price shocks on all sectoral indices except energy and utility found by this study. I also examine the impact of oil price volatility on stock returns. Oil price volatility has a negative and significant effect on all industries, even oil-related and oil substitutes. In addition, I get the VAR estimations for the crisis period and find that there is a substantial increase in the role of oil price shocks in the decomposition of stock returns of all sectors. Furthermore, stock returns are better explained by U.S. oil production shocks than other shocks in most sectors over the financial crisis time period. In addition, I find the asymmetric effects of oil shocks are applicable to only two out of ten sectors, implying the effect of oil price return on equity returns only in the energy and utility sectors are not asymmetric.",

        "abstract": "This study investigates the relationship between quality acceleration and cross-sectional returns, and explores the source of quality acceleration effect. We provide empirical evidence that quality acceleration positively and significantly predicts subsequent stock returns, and this predictive ability of quality acceleration lasts for three months, and does not reverse in the long term. These results are robust to alternative subsamples and alternative measures of quality acceleration, and common anomalies. The prediction information contained in quality acceleration is not subsumed by quality level and quality growth, and even exceeds the prediction information contained in quality level and growth. Consistent with a behavioral mispricing explanation, we find that the quality acceleration effect becomes stronger in the period of high investor sentiment, while the quality acceleration effect becomes weaker or even disappears in the period of low investor sentiment. However, the quality acceleration effect cannot be explained by limits to arbitrage and investor attention. Finally, quality acceleration has incremental predictive power for future one-quarter-ahead earnings growth, as well as future two- and three-quarters-ahead quality growth, which could be overlooked by investors.",

We first examine unexpected (surprise) macroeconomic announcements and then decompose the surprise announcements further into positive and negative shocks. There are significant differences in announcement effects between the US and the EU markets with US macroeconomic announcements being more influential than EU announcements. Sector returns are more responsive to macroeconomic news shocks when decomposed into positive and negative components, as well as being more consistent with the predicted relationships. There is also some evidence of an asymmetric announcement reaction to positive and negative shocks. As sectors respond differently to the global and regional shocks this implies they are not fully integrated and indicates possible risk diversification.",

More importantly, our empirical tests prove that the increased investors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 information demands help to alleviate the net-selling phenomenon as well as its further effects on earnings announcements returns that are resulted from the high information asymmetry during pre-announcement periods.

The disposition effect and the attention effect seem to explain herding behavior at the stock level. At the individual investor level, the cumulative number of buys and portfolio values reduce the prediction of herding behavior, while high values of portfolio return lead to a small increase in herding. Individuals who herd do not outperform either market or non-herd portfolios, suggesting that herding is a behavioral bias. Thus, such behavior seems to destabilize stock markets, creating temporary discrepancies in stock prices followed by reversals back to fundamentals. The most predictive factor in the performance tests of individual portfolios is the market risk premium and using equally-weighted factors rather than value-weighted factors seem to provide more consistent results in the portfolio performance analyses.",

Specifically, disclosure information arrivals tend to increase total volatility, consistent with the uncertainty-generating effect, whereas media coverage reduces volatility, consistent with the notion that media reports resolve information uncertainty for firms. For IDV, both types of news tend to mitigate price synchronicity, suggesting that public information flows mainly contribute to the capitalization of firm-specific information on prices overall.",

Second, I assess whether these two mispricing patterns, i.e., the momentum and reversal effects, are empirically linked. Results reported in this paper show that a zero-investment strategy that is long on consistent winners and short on consistent losers earns substantial average monthly abnormal returns that continue to be economically and statistically significant over the next twelve months. Subsequently, however, the return for the zero-investment portfolio in Years 2 to 5 is negative, resulting in a reversal of the bulk of the initial momentum profit. This evidence suggests that the return momentum and the price reversal anomalies are likely to be driven by the same investor psychology. This finding remains robust to the four-factor regression (the Fama-French three-factor model extended by the momentum factor) and various sensitivity tests.

These results point to leverage as an important driver of cash flow risk. In addition, cash flow risk of small firms is found to be on average lower than that of larger ones.",

In the model, the rational investor trades on information so that the information is gradually incorporated into prices, whereas the sentiment investor trades on sentiment as if it were information. Moreover, the speed of information incorporated into price becomes faster and faster, while the speed of sentiment factored into price gets slower and slower over time. We find that the existence of sentiment investor makes financial market possible, but decreases market efficiency. The model also offers a partial explanation to the financial anomalies of short-run momentum and long-term reversal.",

Even in distinct institutional settings, our empirical results reaffirm the well-known inverse relationship of returns and credit risk, which is robust with regard to cross-sectional and time-series scrutiny. We reveal that the underperformance of low-rated firms around their rating downgrades, when they are subject to both severe illiquidity and short-sale constraints, partially explains the abnormal returns of long\u00e2\u0080\u0093short portfolios, although the returns remain substantial when data associated with downgrades is removed. When targeting delisted firms, we observe that delistings among the lowest-rated firms exhibit extremely poor returns near the time of their downgrades. We find that the abnormal returns become insignificant in the long\u00e2\u0080\u0093short portfolio in the sample, from which delistings are excluded. Our empirical evidence suggests that market mispricing of delisted stocks near the time of their downgrades is a primary cause of the credit risk puzzle.",

Chinese and Indian markets are not exempt. Inefficiencies in these markets are described by many authors as roots of all mispricing. Mispricing might be the outcome of application of familiar asset pricing models which may mislead an investor into adopting inappropriate policies for his new investments or for reallocating his old investments. In an alternative approach, we propose a transformation on original market returns in the objective of relaxing the strong assumption of market efficiency behind application of an asset pricing model.

To conduct this analysis, we used two independently drawn samples, a primary sample, which ran from 2005 to 2015 and, an out of sample comparison, which ran from 1996 to 2008. While conducting our analyses we incorporated a new heat variable and compared its ability to describe aggregate issuance and performance against a standard heat variable, we illustrated how events can affect IPO issuance and performance and incorporated those events into a model of performance and volume, and to incorporate these events into our models we integrated the spline regression technique into our model, which improved the fit of our model substantially over methods that could be seen as alternative modeling techniques. We believe that our use of events in the modeling process provides a more accurate representation of the underlying dynamics of the processes that are causing changes in IPO performance and issuance and that our application of the spline regression technique to model IPO performance and issuance provides researchers with an important tool that could help them to better estimate, model, and understand the true determinates of IPO performance and issuance.",

This is because regarding the latter, the significant price effects of positive and negative news cancel each other out. Considered in isolation, non-negative tweets from Musk lead to significantly positive abnormal Bitcoin returns. Individual tweets do raise the price of Bitcoin by 16.9 % or reduce it by almost 11.8 %.

        "abstract": "Treasury futures, important tools in interest risk management, need to maintain price equilibrium between different varieties. In this paper, we conduct research on ten-, five-, and two-year Treasury futures in China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s futures market. The auto-regression model is used to fit and predict the spot yield, the CTD (cheapest to deliver) price is used in valuing Treasury futures, and the transaction cost and market friction are considered in building the arbitrage-free spread interval. By comparing the amount of deviation and the equilibrium reversion speed, we analyse the inter-variety price equilibrium between Treasury futures. We find that there are many arbitrage opportunities among the three varieties, and the market is not fully efficient. Through further analysis of the pairwise spread relationship of the futures, we conclude that longer operation of the Treasury futures market will lead to higher market efficiency, shorter duration of arbitrage opportunities, and a faster return to equilibrium. The existing literature mainly focuses on the equilibrium relationship between two Treasury futures in statistical terms, but this paper examines the equilibrium relationship between all existing varieties of Treasury futures in China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s market based on pricing, which expands the subject and methods of research on inter-variety equilibrium in Treasury futures.",

We discover that illiquidity levels are significantly enhanced around both the earnings and post announcement period, in both the short and long run.

We find that bondholders react negatively to a late filing announcement but this negative reaction is conditional on whether late filing firms appropriate wealth from bondholders through shareholder distribution. Moreover, we find that the impact of financial distress and covenants on bond values is mainly driven by the wealth appropriation from bondholders. The results are robust to difference-in-difference analysis using treatment (i.e., late filing) and control (i.e., non-late-filing) samples based on propensity score matching. The results provide evidence that shareholder distribution as a specific form of wealth appropriation from bondholders to shareholders has a significant effect on bond values when financial information is not timely provided to capital markets.",

Utilizing recent advancements in market microstructure research to estimate firm-specific proxies for market efficiency, we demonstrate that the existence of the overreaction anomaly (where stock prices of late announcers in response to the earnings reported by early announcers in the same industry are negatively related to subsequent price responses of late announcers to their own earnings reports) is specific to an earlier sample period and results from the inefficient incorporation of information into prices, largely attributable to an environment with high barriers to arbitrage. Our results indicate that the pricing efficiency of intra-industry information transfers has increased in the recent years of increased liquidity and markedly higher trading activity.",

We first identify, categorize, and replicate 100 long-short anomalies in the cross-section of expected equity returns. We then comprehensively study their interaction with popular proxies for time-varying market-level sentiment and arbitrage conditions. We find a powerful (relatively weak) role of the variation in proxies for sentiment (arbitrage constraints). In this context, the predictive power of sentiment is mostly restricted to the short leg of strategy returns. Our insights collectively suggest that the dynamics of sentiment combined with the base level (and not primarily the variations) of limits to arbitrage provide at least a partial explanation for inefficiencies.",

In the model, the fact that the model excludes financial firms is significant because financial firms are a large fraction of the value of the U.S. stock market. Also, there is no theoretical reason for excluding financial firms. Modigliani and Miller (1958, 1963) suggest that leverage affects beta, but it does not invalidate the capital asset pricing model. It would therefore be more satisfying if the pricing model applied generally, rather than being restricted to non-financial corporations. Thus, we assess the validity of size and value risk as common risk factors to measure of the cross-section of expected stock returns in financial companies. Empirical asset pricing tests suggest two findings. First, size and value risk premia commonly exists in both nonfinancial and financial firms, even if two factors are less explicable in financial firms. Second, an interest rate risk premium (\u00ce\u0094L/L) which defined as a financial firm specific risk factor only appears in financial companies.",

While the single-sort momentum strategies returns 11.14% per annum, on average, a consistent reversal pattern of momentum profits is pronounced from 12 to 30months after portfolio formation. Combining the observed reversal pattern with the momentum signal, our double-sort strategy returns 20.24% per annum, which significantly outperforms single-sort strategies. The proposed strategy is robust to seasonality effects and sample adjustments in commodity futures. The profitability of the double-sort strategy cannot be explained by standard risk factors, term structure, market volatility, investor sentiment, data-mining or transaction costs, but appears to be related to global funding liquidity. As a consequence, the double-sort strategy in commodity futures may be employed as a portfolio diversification tool.",

Such insider employs a max-min choice mechanism, so that in any round of trading she selects as her market order that which maximizes her expected profits against those market beliefs which penalize her most. Her trading strategy is equivalent to that of a risk-averse insider who does not face any Knightian uncertain and possesses risk-sensitive recursive preferences. As she finds it optimal to trade more aggressively and reveal her private information at a faster pace than her risk-neutral (expected-profit maximizer) counterpart, we find that ambiguity-aversion is beneficial to the efficiency of the market.",

In this article, we measure cross-sector volatility spillovers, casting light on their intensity in the US-denominated investment grade bond universe. We find that volatility spillovers are high in the US credit market and that the insurance, goods and energy sectors have been net contributors to these shocks over the 1996\u00e2\u0080\u00932017 period. A structural analysis of the spillover history based on a three-regime multivariate VAR Markov Switching model is then proposed. It highlights that with different volatility regimes come different volatility spillover structures: the insurance and goods sectors are volatility spillover sources during crisis periods. However, according to our estimates a large portion of spillovers are non-recurring and therefore difficult to anticipate.",

We hypothesize that the combined total attention to macroeconomic news and earnings announcements helps investors understand both the systematic and firm-specific components of earnings surprises. Consistent with the hypothesis, our results show that the macroeconomic news effect is mainly driven by firms with high exposure to macroeconomic news. Moreover, we show that the effect is stronger when macroeconomic news contains more information and for firms with greater information uncertainty.

This is consistent with both covariance risk and mispricing. Under the framework of the ICAPM, we find little economic justification that an R&D factor is a proxy for innovations to a state variable. The characteristic subsumes the factor loading in direct tests, providing support to the mispricing hypothesis. Investigating the mispricing explanation further, we reject the assertion that the R&D anomaly arises from the correction of stocks mispriced by investor sentiment. A natural experiment exploiting the pilot program under Regulation SHO shows no evidence that the anomaly persists due to limits to arbitrage in the form of short sale constraints.",

This suggests that FinTech coverage improves how accurately stock prices reflect firm-specific information. Our results hold true across multiple testing methods and alternative ways of measuring stock price synchronicity. Further analysis shows that FinTech coverage reduces stock price synchronicity primarily by addressing information gaps between companies and investors. Additionally, greater FinTech coverage improves stock liquidity and lowers the costs of raising debt or equity financing. When examining the topics covered by FinTech firms, we find that diverse coverage topics are linked to lower stock price synchronicity, with discussions on finance, corporate governance, and negative sentiment playing a particularly effective role.

We find evidence to support the price pressure hypothesis for both additions to and deletions from the KLCI. This is because significant stock price and trading volume effects in the pre index revision period are entirely reversed after the announcement of the news. Our empirical findings can be explained by the market microstructure literature. Significant changes in liquidity cause trading volume and stock prices to reverse back to their original level before the index revisions took place.",

These have been difficult to rationalise and evidence on the sources of such profitability is inconclusive.

The sample characteristics, and the fact that derivatives improve the impounding of information into prices, enable us to draw conclusions about the causes of momentum profits. While we find that short sales constraints are not the major driver of profitability and that most momentum profits disappear using two transactions costs measures of the bid\u00e2\u0080\u0093ask spread, one not previously used, the persistence of some momentum profits indicates that the market underreacts even to the most publicly available information.",

This paper develops and tests these hypotheses. Consistent with the model predictions, I find that measures of dispersion are positively related to aggregate valuations, trading volume, idiosyncratic volatility, past market returns, and current and future investor sentiment indexes. Dispersion is a strong negative predictor of subsequent short- and long-term market excess returns. Market beta is positively related to stock returns when the beginning-of-period dispersion is low and this relationship reverses when initial dispersion is high. A simple forecast model based on dispersion significantly outperforms a naive model based on historical equity premium in out-of-sample tests and the predictability is stronger in economic downturns.",

In this paper, we compare the level of information contained in these two commonly used option volume ratios.

Second, in contrast to our first set of results, O/S ratios contain more predictability about future returns at the weekly and monthly levels than P/C ratios. In fact, our tests show that while P/C ratios contain predictability about future daily returns and, to some extent, future weekly returns, the return predictability in P/C ratios is fleeting. O/S ratios, on the other hand, significantly predict negative returns at all levels: daily, weekly, and monthly. While Pan and Poteshman (2006) show that signed P/C ratios, which require proprietary data, have predictive power, we find that unsigned P/C ratios, which do not require proprietary data, also have predictive power.",

Although market timing costs are not lower when Hammer-like and Doji configurations occur, market impact costs are significantly lower when and after a Doji structure occurs. We further check the potential gains through order submission simulations and find that submission strategies based on the occurrence of Doji result in significantly lower market impact cost than random submission strategies.

We find that in the expansion state the expected returns of winner stocks are more affected by aggregate economic conditions than those of loser stocks, while in the recession state the expected returns of loser stocks are more affected than those of winner stocks. Consequently, expected momentum profits display strong procyclical variations. We argue that the observed momentum profits are the realization of such expected returns and can be interpreted as the procyclicality premium. We provide a plausible explanation for time-varying momentum profits through the differential effect of leverage and growth options across business cycles.",

We find that a stochastic discount factor constructed from a set of basis assets helps explain post-earnings-announcement drift (PEAD). The risk exposures on the pricing kernel increase monotonically from the lowest to highest SUE sorted portfolios. Specifically, good-news firms always have higher risk exposures than bad-news firms in both 10 SUE sorted portfolios and 25 size and SUE sorted portfolios. However, the estimated expected risk premium is too small to explain the observed magnitude of returns on the PEAD strategy. Our risk adjustment can explain only about one-fourth of the total magnitude of the average realized return to the PEAD strategy. As a result, the average risk-adjusted returns of earnings momentum strategies are mostly positive and significant. Overall, our results support the view that at least some portion of the returns to the earnings momentum strategies examined represent compensation for bearing increased risk.",

We first offer evidence that there is no dominating momentum strategy among the revenue, earnings, and price momentums, suggesting that revenue surprises, earnings surprises, and prior returns each carry some exclusive unpriced information content. We next show that the profits of momentum driven by firm fundamental performance information (revenue or earnings) depend upon the accompanying firm market performance information (price), and vice versa. The robust monotonicity in multivariate momentum returns is consistent with the argument that the market does not only underestimate the individual information but also the joint implications of multiple information on firm performance, particularly when they point in the same direction. A three-way combined momentum strategy may offer monthly return as high as 1.44%. The information conveyed by revenue surprises and earnings surprises combined account for about 19% of price momentum effects, which finding adds to the large literature on tracing the sources of price momentum.",

Event study method is employed to analyze 25 renewable energy investment announcements during April 2015 and December 2023 period. Announcement date is defined as the event day and the 5 day period before and after the event day is selected as the event window. The length of the pre-event window in the timeline is chosen as 244 days. The total length of the period studied in the study is 250 days. The result of the study reveals that the renewable energy investment announcements of the energy companies listed in Borsa Istanbul seem to have no significant impact on the stock returns. Thus, Borsa Istanbul appears to be semi-strongly efficient.",

One characteristic of this type of crude is that it is sold at a discount rate that can oscillate between a 4- and 10-dollar discount from benchmark indices such as the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) Index and the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) Index. In the present study, we used event study methodology to determine the impact of global, regional, and local macroeconomic news, as well as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) announcements on the Castilla blend price. We found that even though OPEC announcements have a higher impact on prices, macroeconomic news that comes as a surprise from global and regional players had a significant impact on the Castilla blend price for the period under study from 2010 to 2019.",

More specifically, it tests whether the Indian stock market provides an effective hedge against inflation using monthly data on real stock return, inflation and real activity from April 1980 to March 2004 and a two-step estimation procedure. Results of the study indicate that (i) the Indian stock market reflects future real activity; (ii) the negative stock returns-inflation relation emerges from the unexpected component of the inflation and (iii) this negative relation vanishes when we control for the inflation-real activity relation, thereby providing a strong support for Fama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proxy effect hypothesis. The split period analyses provided support for accepting Fama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hypothesis only in pre-reform period. In the post reform period, stock market serves as a hedge against inflation.",

The results of the non-parametric runs test show that index returns on the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) display a predictable component, thus suggesting that traders can earn superior returns by employing trading rules. The statistically significant deviations from randomness are also suggestive of suboptimal allocation of investment capital within the economy. The findings, in general, contradict the weak-form of the efficient markets hypothesis. Finally, a range of policy strategies for improving the allocative capacity and quality of the information environment of the NSE are discussed.",

In addition we investigate, if this relationship is nonlinear. For this we use stock return data of US, German and Japanese car companies, and returns of share indices from the same countries as control variables, and Brent crude oil price changes. We first estimate the impact of crude oil on the indices, then clean the indices from these influences, and afterwards estimate the impact on the stocks. For this we are using OLS and EGARCH (1,1). We conclude that in general the car companies stocks do not react more adversely as the overall market to crude oil price increases, while Japanese companies do not show any excess sensitivity at all. German companies tend to be sensitive, and US and German companies are together more sensitive in the more recent time periods.",

This subject has been examined empirically on the European financial market during 2000-2010. Our empiric findings suggest monotonous relationships between the trading volumes and the schemas of price evolution in terms of the continuity/reversal of prices that vary amongst the trading volume levels as well as amongst the winning and losing shares. Excess volume is thus more dependent on momentum profits for loser portfolios and on contrarian profits for winner portfolios.",

A standard event study methodology, employing the market model, is applied to determine the abnormal returns both on and surrounding the lawsuit filing day. We utilize the Stanford Securities Class Action Clearinghouse Database (SCAC)[1] to collect the initial sample, which contains data on all securities class action. Insofar as we have eliminated any event that could contaminate the event to capture only the effects linked to the announcement, our sample is then restricted to three events corresponding to three different companies.The results show the absence of a significant reaction for the ten days preceding the lawsuit filings as well as for the ten days following the lawsuit filings. This paper uses stock market reaction to gauge the merit of Securities class action (SCAs) and the results shows that the market has a modest ability to discern meritorious filings from frivolous filings.",

Then we examine the particular impact of each type of ETF trade on the market volatility of the tracked index. Focusing on the three ETFs tracking the CSI 300, we show that ETF trades stemming from investor disagreement are a key determinant of CSI 300 volatility, dominating other factors considered. Liquidity ETF trades can partially explain CSI 300 volatility. However, little evidence supports a significant correlation between privately informed trades of ETFs and CSI 300 volatility.",

By applying a novel measure to their trade-by-trade transactions to capture their tendency in risk-taking, we find a general tendency to reduce risk-taking by cutting positions when facing losses or gains, and the tendency is stronger in the case of losses. However, great variations exist among traders in the risk-taking tendency and the results for trading are opposite for profitable and unprofitable traders. For the unprofitable, more risk-taking by trading more actively leads to greater losses. This is concrete evidence for the prevailing belief in the literature that trading too much, arguably due to overconfidence, is hazardous to investor's wealth. Contrary to that belief, however, we find fresh evidence that more active trading by the profitable traders leads to greater profits, suggesting their trades are likely based on ability and skills.",

The measurement of permanent price impact is converted to the price discovery problem solved by a quantile vector error correction model. Empirical results using the high frequency data in the Chinese stock market indicate that both liquidity and order flows contribute to the permanent component of the EPMs. However, liquidity is the dominating factor, which accounts for more than 60\u00e2\u0080\u009380% of the information share in EPMs scenarios.",

        "abstract": "The present paper investigates the causal link between returns and volume in cryptocurrency markets. Relative to earlier empirical studies on the topic, it employs a flexible methodological approach that allows the intensity and the pattern of the link to vary with the traders\u00e2\u0080\u0099 planning horizon (shorter vs longer runs) and the nature of the preceding price shocks (positive vs negative). Causality is bi-directional implying that: (a) volume-based technical analysis can lead to higher profits and (b) trend-following is likely to be a common investment strategy among rational uninformed traders. There is, therefore, scope for establishing appropriate disclosure systems to deal with information asymmetry and the risk associated with it. In the longer-run, spillovers from returns to volume are stronger than those in the opposite direction. The same, generally, applies to spillovers from positive relative to negative returns. Consequently, returns (especially the positive ones) are more likely to induce fundamental changes in traders\u00e2\u0080\u0099 expectations compared to volume.",

        "abstract": "Despite increasing research on firm-specific news, it is unclear how the media affects the assimilation of macroeconomic news by futures markets. To fill this gap, we employ scheduled and non-scheduled macroeconomic announcements, as well as 60,030 instances of macroeconomic news reporting in China, to investigate the media\u00e2\u0080\u0099s role in transmitting macroeconomic news to the gold futures market. We find that macroeconomic announcements, while necessary, may not be sufficient to drive the gold futures market. Meanwhile, the media\u00e2\u0080\u0094as a vital intermediary\u00e2\u0080\u0094is essential for news absorption; the effect is stronger for national and political media. Further, the gold futures market asymmetrically reacts to good and bad news; only reporting on good news can invoke significant market responses. Our findings demonstrate the importance of the information environment cultivated by powerful media in improving the efficiency of financial markets, and help to explain why bad news moves slowly from a media perspective.",

Further investigation shows that investors' preference for green stocks increases the valuation of such stocks and contributes to the profitability of the trading strategy. We construct a green taste measure using textual analysis of over 400,000 analyst reports, finding that when agents' green tastes increase unexpectedly, the sustainability-based trading strategy generates higher returns in the future.

By examining the mechanism, we find that investors, particularly institutional investors, favor stocks with higher MTR beta, resulting in excessive net buying pressure and liquidity constraints.

Conversely, the momentum effect prevails in larger cryptocurrencies but incurs substantial trading costs and extracts alphas largely from short positions.

The average cross-fund correlation in idiosyncratic returns measures diversification of idiosyncratic risk, while the correlation of predicted returns from the multifactor model measures factor risk diversification within a fund family. We document a substantial cross-sectional variation in family-level diversification measured with our new proxies independent of the number of funds and objectives in the family. While number of objectives is a popular yet possibly misleading measure of diversification, there is a link between portfolio theory-based diversification measures and the number of objectives in a family. On average, fund families with more investment objectives are more diversified in terms of both idiosyncratic and factor risks; yet, in large families, more investment objectives are associated with increased diversification of idiosyncratic risk but decreased diversification of factor risk. Fund family diversification improves family performance during market downturns and in large families. However, fund family diversification does not significantly affect absolute or relative family size, except for the number of investment objectives, which has a negative relation to family size.",

We adopt two new alternative testing and estimation methods: the improved augmented regression method and wild bootstrapping of predictive model based on a restricted VAR form. Both methods take explicit account of endogeneity of predictors, providing bias-reduced estimation and improved statistical inference in small samples. From monthly data of 16 Asia-Pacific (including U.S.) and 21 European stock markets from 2000 to 2014, we find that the financial ratios show weak predictive ability with small effect sizes and poor out-of-sample forecasting performances. In contrast, the price pressure and interest rate are found to be strong predictors for stock return with large effect sizes and satisfactory out-of-sample forecasting performance.",

Resiliency is defined as quickness of the transitory price recovery from a liquidity shock.

Initial tests contribute to the exchange rate puzzle by showing that a common macroeconomic risk component in currency markets is present in global equity markets. Subsequent tests indicate that the spread on zero-cost currency momentum strategies is larger and highly significant in high RD states compared to low RD states. Also, the relation between these momentum payoffs and global economic risk appears to increase linearly in risk.

Further we introduce the mixed-frequency dynamic factor analysis to extract the common sentiment factor, which shows stronger correlation with contemporaneous iVX, compared with the sentiment indexes at each level.

However, how state ownership affects price informativeness is less-explored, much less the impacts of differing forms of state ownership. We find that the price synchronicity of SOEs is about 9.0% to 15.4% larger than that of non-SOEs, indicating that SOEs have less informative stock prices. Institutional environment and government regulations such as anti-corruption campaigns are important mediating factors in reducing price synchronicity, but the price synchronicity of SOEs is still significantly larger than that of non-SOEs. Differences in state ownership matters for price synchronicity. SOEs associated with local governments (SOELGs), as well as those represented by state assets management bureaus (SAMBs), have larger price synchronicity than non-SOEs. Although SOEs controlled by central governments (SOECGs) also have larger price synchronicity than non-SOEs based on univariate tests, this difference becomes statistically insignificant when controlling for other factors. SOEs are less likely to be publicly exposed for fraud, implying that state ownership provides a buffer for SOEs. Overall, we evidence that state ownership has an important role in deprecating stock-price informativeness, with the impact differing depending on whether SOEs are controlled by central or non-central governments.",

Empirically, utilizing monthly data from January 1995 to December 2019, we provide new supporting evidence that there are seasonalities and seasonal reversals in the cross-section. Interestingly, the occurrence of seasonal reversals takes a longer time than that of the U.S. market. Next, we explore explanations for cross-sectional seasonalities. The tests based upon macroeconomic risk, mood beta, and limits of arbitrage suggest that seasonalities are likely driven by temporary mispricing. Finally, we construct seasonality and seasonal reversal factors to study the investment value of seasonalities. We find that these factors can significantly increase the monthly Sharpe ratio by up to 0.34 and capture incremental information in predicting future returns relative to other well-known factors.",

By creating a filtered dataset of stocks held by hedge funds in China from 2010 to 2019, we examine the effect of the network on stock return comovement and further test the incentive-compatible conditions for honest communication between competitors (Stein, 2008). First, we find that the weak ties in a social network affect the behaviour of hedge fund managers, when formal institutions are imperfect. Second, we find that listed firms held by hedge funds are exposed to an information network that is composed of hedge funds. The higher the hedge fund network density is, the more likely information dissemination is, and the weaker the stock price comovement is. Third, our results support Stein's (2008) two major conclusions: a network effect exists only within stable relationships, and the more central a stock is in the network, the stronger the network effect is. After controlling for various external factors that might influence the hedge fund network's information diffusion mechanism, all the results meet our theoretical expectations. Overall, we contribute to the literature by determining the role of the hedge fund network as an information transmitter in weak ties and by providing empirical evidence on the theory of honest communication among competitors.",

We then describe and quantify crowd wisdom from investor-generated content (IGC) using three dimensions (IGC average sentiment, IGC sentiment volatility, and IGC increased volume) to investigate the impact of crowd wisdom in the relationship between investors' Internet searches and next-day stock returns. In our empirical analysis, we find that IGC average sentiment strengthens the relationship between investors' Internet searches and next-day stock returns, while IGC sentiment volatility and IGC increased volume have negative effects. These moderating effects are also moderated by institutional investor attention, search terminal preference, and content reading volume.

We characterize and analyze the equilibrium order placement strategies of traders and the conditional execution probabilities of limit orders as a function of traders\u00e2\u0080\u0099 liquidity demand and the state of the limit order book. We solve for the equilibrium of the model numerically, and analyze its properties by performing comparative dynamics analysis. Our analysis shows that changes in the steady state of the limit order book and optimal order placement strategies reflect corresponding changes in the trade-off between order execution risk and the size of potential trading gains. The equilibrium order flow depends on the current state of the limit order book since a trader's optimal trading strategy is largely affected by the time and price priorities of the existing limit orders in the book. We demonstrate how changes in the dispersion of traders\u00e2\u0080\u0099 private values affect optimal trading strategies and conditional execution probabilities of limit orders. Our main result is that the dispersion in private values across traders has a significant impact on the stationary state of the equilibrium limit order book and the average bid\u00e2\u0080\u0093ask spread. A wider distribution of private values leads to more order placement at prices away from the consensus value, and therefore, to a larger bid\u00e2\u0080\u0093ask spread. Further, our numerical simulations show that extending the life span of limit orders reduces the average bid\u00e2\u0080\u0093ask spread observed in equilibrium.

We find that the typical negative news significantly and persistently compresses 10-y yields in the US and other developed economies, leading to cumulative effects close to \u00e2\u0088\u009267 bp and \u00e2\u0088\u009232 bp over the sample period, respectively. These episodes also significantly reduce stock markets in the US and other developed economies, with cumulative effects close to 23 and 14% for developed and emerging economies, respectively. For emerging countries, we also find significant currency depreciations against the USD. These results are confirmed with an alternative identification based on time-varying volatility. Given the relatively larger impacts on long-term yields, as well as the differential effects across developed and emerging markets, we conclude that the dominant channel behind the effects are increases in global risk aversion, as opposed to worsening perspectives about global growth prospects.",

Margin requirements are higher overnight, and lending fees are typically charged only on positions held overnight. Such institutional constraints and overnight risk incentivize arbitrageurs who trade on mispricing to reduce their positions before the end of the day. Consistent with this intuition, a mispricing factor earns positive returns throughout the day but performs poorly at the end of the day. This pattern strengthens in the second half of the sample and is shared by several well-known anomalies.",

It shows that the effect of a longer investment horizon appears as a reduction in the fraction of the strategy adopted by long-term traders under the assumption of no autocorrelation among the excess returns on the asset. Specifically, it considers the case where long-term traders are fundamentalists and short-term traders are technical analysts. In this case, the main result obtained by Brock and Hommes (1998) that an increase in the intensity of choice to switch predictors can lead to market instability is robust provided that short-term traders bear lower costs than long-term traders. Furthermore, when short-term traders bear no costs, long-term trading by fundamentalists destabilizes the market in the sense that the pitchfork or the period doubling bifurcation value of the intensity of choice decreases compared with the corresponding values in Brock and Hommes (1998).",

This is a direct measure of mood that does not pre-specify certain mood-affecting events nor assume the extent of their impact on investors. We validate our music-based sentiment measure by correlating it with mood swings induced by seasonal factors, weather conditions, and COVID-related restrictions. We find that music sentiment is positively correlated with same-week equity market returns and negatively correlated with next-week returns, consistent with sentiment-induced temporary mispricing. Results also hold under a daily analysis and are stronger when trading restrictions limit arbitrage. Music sentiment also predicts increases in net mutual fund flows, and absolute sentiment precedes a rise in stock market volatility.

Strategies long (short) stocks with positive (negative) lagged jump returns earn significantly positive returns over the next one- to three-month horizons. The results based on intraday jumps, especially overnight jumps, provide further evidence consistent with underreaction. The underreaction is robust to controlling for other firm characteristics, extends stock return momentum over intermediate to short horizons, and captures market underreaction to information shocks beyond earnings surprises. We further show that limited investor attention contributes to short-term underreaction.",

It outperforms substantially the well-known short-term reversal, momentum, and long-term reversal factors, which are based on the three price trends separately, by more than doubling their Sharpe ratios. During the recent financial crisis, the trend factor earns 0.75% per month, while the market loses \u00e2\u0088\u00922.03% per month, the short-term reversal factor loses \u00e2\u0088\u00920.82%, the momentum factor loses \u00e2\u0088\u00923.88%, and the long-term reversal factor barely gains 0.03%.

Between 1980 and 2010, the industry-neutral long-short hedge portfolio earns an average of over 19 basis points per week. This predictability is related to common institutional ownership and is distinct from previously documented lead-lag effects. Common institutional ownership is a complementary rather than a substitute explanation for return predictability. Information linkages are enough to induce return predictability among stocks in the same industry, but economically unrelated stocks exhibit return predictability only when they have common institutional owners.

This solution can be computed using only a few extra steps beyond maximum likelihood estimation and does not require a comprehensive or bias-free database. We then apply our methodology to a sample of domestic diversified equity mutual funds and ask what prior beliefs would imply zero investment in active managers?' To justify such a zero-investment strategy, we find that a mean-variance investor would need to believe that less than 1 out of every 100,000 managers has an expected alpha greater than 25 basis points per month. Overall, our analysis suggests that even when the average manager is expected to underperform passive benchmarks, it requires very strong prior beliefs to imply zero investment in managers with the best past performance.",

Using the quantile regression model, we demonstrate that the effect of the West Texas Intermediate crude oil price (WTI), Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU) index, volatility index (VIX), and USD index (USDX) on total spillover varies over quantiles in terms of magnitude and direction.

Since intangible assets are not reported on financial statements under current U.S. accounting standards and R&D spending is expensed, the valuation problem may be especially challenging. Nonetheless we find that historically the stock returns of firms doing R&D on average matches the returns on firms with no R&D. For companies engaged in R&D, high R&D intensity has a distinctive effect on returns for two groups of stocks. Within the set of growth stocks, R&D-intensive stocks tend to out-perform stocks with little or no R&D. Companies with high R&D relative to equity market value (who tend to have poor past returns) show strong signs of mis-pricing. In both cases the market apparently fails to give sufficient credit for firms' R&D investments. Our exploratory investigation of the effects of advertising on returns yields similar results. We also provide evidence that R&D intensity is positively associated with return volatility, everything else equal. Insofar as the association reflects investors' lack of information about firms' R&D activity, increased accounting disclosure may be beneficial.",

The transactions-based approach of Daniel, Grinblatt, Titman and Wermers (1997) yields a median improvement in precision of 10 percent over the 4-factor model of Carhart (1997a), with the former approach providing more precise estimates of abnormal performance for more than 80 percent of the newsletters.

With financial frictions, investment is less elastic, meaning that a given magnitude of change in investment is associated with a higher magnitude of change in the discount rate.

Consistent with this prediction, we document that the asset growth, external finance, and accrual anomalies in the cross-section of stock returns are much stronger in financially more constrained firms than in financially less constrained firms.

This paper focuses on one important source of information to the foreign exchange markets, the intervention operations of the G-3 central banks. Previous studies using daily and weekly foreign exchange rate data suggest that central bank intervention operations can influence both the level and variance of exchange rates, but little is known about how exactly traders learn of these operations and whether intra-daily market conditions influence the effectiveness of central bank interventions. This paper uses high-frequency data to examine the relationship between the efficacy of intervention operations and the 'state of the market' at the moment that the operation is made public to traders. The results indicate that some traders know that a central bank is intervening at least one hour prior to the public release of the information in newswire reports. Also, the evidence suggests that the timing of intervention operations matter interventions that occur during heavy trading volume and that are closely timed to scheduled macro announcements are the most likely to have large effects. Finally, post-intervention mean reversion in both exchange rate returns and volatility indicate that dealer inventories are affected by market reactions to intervention news.",

The average household generates an additional return of 3.7% per year from its local holdings relative to its non-local holdings, suggesting local investors are able to exploit local knowledge.

It aggregates transactions drawn from a large universe of approximately $6 trillion of institutional funds. To analyze style behavior, we assign equities to deciles in each of five style dimensions: size, value/growth, cyclical/defensive, sector, and country. We find, first, strong evidence that investors organize and trade stocks across style-driven lines. This appears true for groupings both strongly and weakly related to fundamentals (e.g., industry or country groupings versus size or value/growth deciles). Second, the positive linkage between flows and returns emerges at daily frequencies, yet becomes even more important at lower frequencies. We show that quarterly decile flows and returns are even more strongly positively correlated than are daily flows and returns. However, as the horizon increases beyond a year, we find that the flow/return correlation declines. Third, style flows and returns are important components of individual stock expected returns. We find that nearby style inflows and returns positively forecast future returns while distant style inflows and returns forecast negatively. Fourth, we find strong correlations between style flows and temporary components of return. This suggests that behavioral theories may play a role in explaining the popularity and price impact of flow-related trading.",

Empirical work based on the analysis shows that inventory information in FX does indeed forecast discount factors, and does so over both short and long horizons. The immediate price impact of shocks to inventory information is large, roughly 50 percent of that from public information shocks (the latter being the whole story under symmetric information).

        "abstract": "This paper studies the impact of first opening margin trading on stock return, return volatility, and turnover rates via an event study. The results indicate that there is no relationship between changes in stock return volatility and industry sectors after opening margin trading. The different firm sizes make the TSE and OTC non-electric sector's stock return volatility has significant variation earlier than electric sector's when we prolong the investigate period. For turnover rate, opening margin trading can increase the TSE's turnover rate significantly. The result also shows that considering both sectors and firm sizes, they still have different turnover rates in the mid- and long-term. In addition, opening margin trading does have information content on the stock returns. During the event window, the electric sectors of both TSE and OTC have higher stock returns. All sectors except the OTC's non-electric sector have positive impacts by opening margin trading. It follows from what has been said that the TSE's electric sector is a better investment target during our sample period and its CAAR increases more in the bull market than in the bear market.",

The empirical results support the complementary hypothesis for earnings announcements that precede dividend announcements. Specifically, when evaluating an unexpected dividend signal, the investors tend to consult prior earnings information and react positively. Further tests find this complementary correlation to be stronger when accompanying negative, unexpected dividend signals. In contrast, I do not find complementary or substitution effects between dividend announcements that precede earnings announcements. In addition, the evidence indicates significant information content for unexpected revenue after controlling for unexpected earnings and dividends.",

For markets with more than two assets, these portfolios are not functionally generated (except for the identity permutation), so we use rank-based methods to analyze their behavior. The reverse-wighted portfolio is the permutation-weighted portfolio with weights proportional to the market weights, but reversed by rank. We show that in a market represented by a first-order model with rank-symmetric variance parameters, the reverse-weighted portfolio will outperform the market portfolio over the long term. This result carries over to a commodity futures market with rank-based parameters similar to those of such a first-order model. In this market we find that the reverse-weighted portfolio outperforms the price-weighted market portfolio from 1977\u00e2\u0080\u00932018.",

This paper is devoted to analyze certain company specific and market factors that may influence premiums between A and H shares. An appropriate factor model is built based on a sample from 63 listed companies in both markets from January 2014 to June 2017. Our factors are useful to explain premium variations. In addition to typical market and company specific factors, it is found premium levels are significantly related to the industry sector in general. Meanwhile, it is observed that premiums of many shares are becoming narrower in recent years, which might pave the way to convergence after closer links between the Mainland and Hong Kong stock exchanges.",

Our results show a sharp decline in the cross-market efficiency during the financial crisis. We investigate whether this is due to lower internal market efficiency or higher market co-movement. The results show no evidence that the internal market efficiency dropped in Hong Kong or Shanghai during the crisis.

I analyze whether these associations are explained by a different investor clientele outside trading hours (the open of the trading session) compared to during trading hours (intraday and closing of the trading session). I find that institutional ownership increases more with returns during trading hours; the finding indicates that those returns are mainly determined by institutional investors, while midday-recess and overnight returns, that is, returns outside trading hours, are not.

For several periods, however, the Hurst exponent was found to be significantly less than 0.5, making the time series anti-persistent during those periods.

        "abstract": "Convertible debt that shares the characteristics of debt and equity is perceived to be riskier than straight debt, therefore the issuance announcement tends to lead to adverse market reaction. In this study we show that convertible debt issuance announcement is also associated with negative abnormal returns with evidence from the Malaysia capital market. We argue that the substantially smaller and illiquid convertible debt market do not affect the consistency of the findings. However, the main purpose of this study is to examine the effect of frequency and sequence of convertible debt issuance announcement on the issuers stock return. We find that both the frequency and sequence of issuance significantly affect the announcement returns. In the longer event window, we observe negative abnormal returns for the infrequent issuers. While frequent issuers report positive abnormal returns. Looking at the sequence of issuance, the first issues of convertible debt lead to negative market reaction, but as the information gap decreases, subsequent issues of convertible debt lead to insignificant abnormal returns. We argue that the findings of this study are mainly related to the theories of asymmetric information and sequential financing. In brief, this study contributes to the convertible debt literature by highlighting the need to incorporate the effect of frequency and sequence in examining the announcement effect of securities. Furthermore, this study adds that the additional features of convertible debt such as redeemable, non-redeemable, secured and unsecured do have significant impact on the announcement returns.",

The empirical evidence suggests that arbitrage trading alone cannot account for all of the mean reversion in basis changes, even when infrequent trading is controlled for. This general mean reversion is consistent with mean reversion in liquidity and partial adjustment in the cash market. The behavior of arbitrageurs appears highly competitive. We find that on average the net arbitrage profit is at the competitive level of zero. Furthermore, it is suggested that some mispricing persistence may be related to time-varying liquidity. Accordingly, the results indicate that arbitrageurs pay attention to the depth of the market and value the early unwinding option.",

        "abstract": "Research Question: Would the COVID-19 pandemic induce investment opportunities or threats for companies listed at Bursa Malaysia? Motivation: This study investigates whether the market strength and information asymmetry experienced during a crisis and industrial characteristics have an impact on shareholders\u00e2\u0080\u0099 abnormal returns. Idea: The study uses market strength as measured by trading volume and information asymmetry as measured by bid-ask spread aims to suggest potential investment opportunities in different categories of industries for investors. Data: The study uses data of 620 companies listed on Bursa Malaysia, collected from 16 Mar 2020 to 9 Jun 2020. The data were divided into 3 event windows based on the government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Movement Control Order (MCO) announcements. Method/ Tools: The event study method is used to calculate the cumulative abnormal returns (CAR) as the dependent variable. Multiple regression analysis with hierarchical model specifications were used in assessing the impact of the explanatory variables on the dependent variables. Findings: The findings suggest that during periods of uncertainty, firm characteristics such as larger and older firms are at a disadvantage compared to smaller and younger firms. In terms of market characteristics, the study shows that Increased trading volume has greater returns to investors. However, the bigger bid-ask spread associated with higher abnormal returns reflects the inefficiency of the stock market. This study also found that in the month following the announcement of the first MCO, the CAR of firms in vulnerable industries reduced by an extra 5% compared to firms who were not classified as vulnerable industry category. As the MCO prolonged, the CAR of firms in vulnerable industries fell by an extra 9.5% compared to other firms listed in Bursa Malaysia. The negative impact on the vulnerable industries shows glooming prospects of those firms. Contributions: Market reactions to pandemics and MCOs are negative especially at the beginning period. The strength of the market, information asymmetry, and industrial characteristics have a strong influence on the abnormal returns during the observed periods. The study also shows that historical financial track records are not good predictors of a firm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s prospects during this unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic.",

Consistent with the selection criterion used for the index, there is no evidence for a stock price effect at the announcement of a change in the index. However, deleted stocks experience an abnormal return averaging \u00e2\u0080\u009313% in a six-month period before the deletion and a decrease in trading volume and efficiency of stock prices following the deletion. For added stocks, the average abnormal return is 8% and there is no significant change in trading volume or efficiency. These long-run effects are best explained by the imperfect substitutes hypothesis or the information costs/liquidity hypothesis, suggesting that stocks in the KFX Index are exposed to a higher demand or more attention and a lower cost of trading than stocks outside the index. However, the results do not rule out the possibility that part of the stock price effect is due to the selection criterion used for the KFX Index.

Our investigations reveal empirical evidence for the importance of volume data as an indicator of the flow of information into the market. These results are in line with suggestions from the Mixture of Distribution Hypothesis.

The investigation is pursued in the Dax index options market, by using synchronous prices matched in a one minute interval. The results highlight that the information content of implied volatility has a humped shape, with out of the money options being less informative than at the money ones.

That is, Taiwan\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s tourism market does not fulfil the conditions of a strong-form efficient market hypothesis. Also, positive feedback trading does exit in Taiwan\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s tourism market.",

To the best of my knowledge, the article becomes the first to show that market liquidity does matter to CDS pricing in Japan, by looking into a sole benchmark index of CDS trading for investment-grade debt claims, or the Markit iTraxx Japan (MiJ). The impact of illiquidity on MiJ premia has declined since the International Swaps and Derivatives Association introduced new trade practices in April 2009. The liquidity of the MiJ has increased since the Japan Securities Clearing Corporation started operating as a central counterpart for the MiJ in July 2011. The price discovery ability of the MiJ has also increased since then.",

Using a mispricing indicator that measures deviations from a stock\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fundamental value, we find higher levels of short selling for temporarily overvalued stocks. The result is robust to controlling for short sale constraints and illiquidity, and it is more pronounced when short sale constraints do not bind and stocks are illiquid. We also find that informed short sellers are able to distinguish temporary overpricing from upward return momentum. However, when fundamental news is released, short sellers focus on exploiting negative fundamental changes rather than temporary overpricing. Short sellers contribute to market quality by correcting overpricing quickly over time, but they do not destabilize the market.",

        "abstract": "Abstract This paper empirically explores the short- and long-run effects of fiscal and monetary policies on US stock returns and tests the validity of market efficiency. The results support the presence of a strong long-run (equilibrium) relation binding stock prices with fiscal (but not monetary) policy. Further tests assign a dominant role to fiscal policy as a main force driving the overall equilibrium relation with the stock market. Estimates from error-correction models corroborate the existence of robust long-run relation and further suggest that past fiscal (but not monetary) policy actions exert significant short-run effects on current stock returns. A similar verdict emerged from alternative estimates in which fiscal policy actions anticipated from an ex ante equation continue to support a significant lagged relation with current stock returns. These results provide consistent evidence that important effects of fiscal policy are transmitted to the real economy through the stock market. Moreover, the results for fiscal policy appear at variance with market efficiency. However, transaction costs and other well-known modeling caveats may impede implications for profitable investment strategies.",

        "abstract": "Abstract We evaluate the robustness of momentum returns in the US stock market over the period 1965\u00e2\u0080\u00932012. We find that momentum profits have become insignificant since the late 1990s. Investigations of momentum profits in high and low volatility months address the concerns about unprecedented levels of market volatility in this period rendering momentum strategy unprofitable. Momentum profits remain insignificant in tests designed to control for seasonality, up or down market conditions, firm size and liquidity. Past returns, can no longer explain the cross-sectional variation in stock returns, even following up markets. Investigation of post holding period returns of momentum portfolios and risk adjusted buy and hold returns of stocks in momentum suggests that investors possibly recognize that momentum strategy is profitable and trade in ways that arbitrage away such profits. These findings are partially consistent with Schwert (Handbook of the economics of finance. Elsevier, Amsterdam, 2003) that documents two primary reasons for the disappearance of an anomaly in the behavior of asset prices, first, sample selection bias, and second, uncovering of anomaly by investors who trade in the assets to arbitrage it away. In further analyses we find evidence that suggest two other possible explanations for the declining momentum profits, besides uncovering of the anomaly by investors, that involve decline in the risk premium on a macroeconomic factor, growth rate in industrial production in particular and relative improvement in market efficiency.",

While the existence of this anomalous pattern is well-established, its underlying causes are the subject of much debate. Recent research also shows that transaction costs can lead to apparent market anomalies such as the post-earnings-announcement drift. We combine these two lines of research and posit that the positive relation between R&D increases and future abnormal stock returns is due to transaction costs. Consistent with this hypothesis, we find that abnormal returns on R&D-based, zero-net-investment portfolios disappear after incorporating standard measures of transaction costs. Overall, our results show that the R&D-abnormal return anomaly is more likely due to transaction costs than to the alternative hypotheses of market inefficiency or omitted risk factors.",

In addition, the trading of investment companies, including mutual funds, has become positively related to REIT crash risk in recent years. Next, when we classify REIT institutional investors by their investment behavior, we find that REIT crash risk is positively related to the trading of transient institutional investors, which trade frequently to maximize short-term gains. Moreover, the adverse impact of transient investors on REIT crash risk has worsened recently. These findings highlight the heterogeneous impacts of different types of institutional investors on REIT crash risk, which has important implications for REIT market participants and policymakers.",

Except for several subperiods associated with the half- and one-year window, the two series are tied together through cointegration and adjust equally toward the long-run relationship. Considering different forecasting lengths, the out-of-sample Granger causality test for each window generally reveals that no series gains forecastability from another. These results shed light on the evolving causal structure between the two series, which is determined to be stable. The futures market, however, has not been fully developed to serve as a price discovery source. Increasing openness of investment channels and policy incentives to attract well-informed traders may stimulate futures market development.",

This paper develops a sequential trade model with constrained short selling to derive the effect on prices when the market maker can observe short selling in the order flow. The model predicts that market quotes will adjust differently to short sales and regular sales. Furthermore, the model shows that the probability of informed trading is impacted both by the level of short sale constraints and the intensity of actual short sale trades. Simulation evidence confirms that estimates of the probability of informed trade are improved when accounting for past short selling activity. The results demonstrate the information benefits of short selling transparency.",

This intriguing question can be explored in the context of the 2015 Chinese market turmoil with frequent government interventions and its aftermath when unprecedentedly severe restrictions were imposed on the trading of the CSI 300 index futures. The intraday price discovery, studied via VECM, became weakly bidirectional over the boom phase from October 2014 to June 2015, in contract to the index futures\u00e2\u0080\u0099 strong leading before the boom. The futures\u00e2\u0080\u0099 leading status weakened drastically over the crash phase between June and September 2015, probably due to the government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interference with the stock market. Surprisingly, the futures under severe trading restrictions after the crash from September 2015 to June 2016 still led the spot weakly, and the volatility spillover to the index was somewhat significant. Policywise, the empirical findings imply that government interventions or trading restrictions weaken the functioning of markets.",

The results show that combination pays off and, moreover, that the benefits of combination are greater in Germany than in most other developed stock markets. Particularly, we find strong evidence of the added-value of using Piotroski\u00e2\u0080\u0099s F-score as a supplementary selection criterion for value stocks as well as for low-accrual stocks. Our results show further that the F-score also boosts the efficacy of other valuation ratios besides the book-to-price ratio. In addition, the inclusion of F-score besides a relative value measure tends to increase the average market equity of portfolio firms. The decomposition of the full-sample-period performance into separate bull- and bear-period performance shows clearly that the better performance of F-score-boosted portfolios is mostly attributable to their outperformance during bearish periods, even though on average, they also generate higher bull-period returns than the comparable value portfolios formed without F-score. The use of F-score as a supplementary criterion also increases the proportion of stocks that earn above-market-average returns during the subsequent holding period. For the first time in the financial literature, we also document a strong relationship between high F-score stocks and momentum stocks.",

        "abstract": "This study investigated how airline stock prices respond to fuel price shocks using the asymmetric Glosten-Jagannathan-Runkle GARCH (GJR-GARCH (1,1)) model. Six airlines were selected, based on their service regions: American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, and United Airlines are larger international carriers that use various types of aircraft in their fleets and provide services in major continents, whereas Southwest Airlines, JetBlue Airways, and US Airways emphasize domestic market services and primarily use single-aisle aircraft. West Texas Intermediate Crude Oil (WTI) prices were adopted as the index of fuel prices. Based on our empirical results, a fuel price shock triggered fluctuations in airline stock returns. Moreover, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United, Airlines and US Airways experienced statistically significant negative relationships between their stock returns and fuel price shocks. Also, fuel price shocks significantly impacted airline stock returns during periods in which fuel prices increased but did not correlate with them during those in which such prices fell",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an overview of several econometric tools available to test for the presences of asset price bubbles. For demonstrative purpose, the tools were applied to historical stock price and dividend data starting from 1871 through 2014. The earliest tools developed were Shiller\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s variance bound tests and West\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s two step procedure. Though these tools are useful in detecting asset prices, they are subject to some serious econometric issues. To address these limitations, Cointegration methods were used to detect asset price bubbles. Unfortunately, if there are collapsing bubbles, Cointegration techniques cannot identify multiple bubbles. To overcome this Phillips, Shi and Yu (2015) developed a right tailed Augmented DickeyFuller test. This test not only identifies multiple bubbles but also dates the starting and ending period of a bubble. Availability of such real time monitoring tool would significantly help investors, retirees, and portfolio managers to rebalance their portfolios during such bubble periods",

        "abstract": "Abstract Holding earnings surprises constant, investors react negatively to delayed earnings announcements. One standard deviation of delay (5 days) corresponds to about 21 bps negative abnormal returns over a two-day announcement window. We show that the results are robust after further controlling for various firm characteristics, earnings characteristics, and the industry effect. We examine alternative explanations, including the earnings manipulation hypothesis proposed in the literature, which suggests that delayed earnings announcements are susceptible to manipulation and are thus discounted by investors. We find no evidence supporting the earnings manipulation hypothesis. Instead, our results are consistent with the effect of concurrent information disclosure. We show that there is a cluster of bad news for late announcements. As investors react to not only a firm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own announcements but also concurrent earnings announcements, the negative information of concurrent announcements contributes significantly to lower stock returns. In addition, information update by the management and analysts also has a significant effect on market reactions to delayed announcements. In particular, information update by analysts may help the market to incorporate future earnings information more efficiently into stock prices. We show direct evidence that negative market reactions to delayed earnings announcements contain information of future earnings.",

Using textual analysis, we develop a simple measure of such misleading information based on the difference between the emphasis placed on business lines in the main textual description and the corresponding information from the accounting tables. We examine our measure of misleading information using a sample of 1878 IPOs in China from 2010 to 2019. We find that the degree of misleading information is greater when firms find it more difficult to get regulatory approval for an IPO. Furthermore, the amount of misleading information is greater for firms with higher leverage and more segmented businesses. We also find some evidence that the stock returns of firms which present a greater amount of misleading information are lower.",

Market states refer to the states of market such as up or down markets. In this paper, the formation period is defined as in an up (down) state if the market return over the six-month period prior to the holding period is nonnegative (negative). The results indicate that market states in the formation period are positively associated with the profitability of the momentum strategies. The results are consistent with the overreaction theory developed in Daniel et al. (2004). Moreover, the empirical results indicate that market states in the holding period are negatively associated with the profitability of the momentum strategies. The holding period is defined as in an up (down) state if the market return in the six-month period following the formation period is nonnegative (negative). The momentum profits appear to be higher in a bearish holding period and lower for a bullish holding period.

Empirical results show that the riskneutral skewness tends to be more (less) negative under bearish (bullish) investor sentiment, and the significant relations become stronger especially when there are more impediments to arbitrage in stock options. In addition, the empirical results show that increased bearishness among market investors who dominate the use of index options increases the extent to which risk-neutral skewness is affected by fluctuations in investor sentiment for the underlying stocks.

We make two key contributions to the literature. First, we employ a robust event study methodology based on Fama-French Momentum Model with EGARCH to explore the price/volume dynamics associated with DJIA Index additions and deletions. Second, we extend earlier work by incorporating all index reconstitution announcements after Dow Jones & Company began preannouncing index changes in 1990. Our results show that index additions (deletions) experience temporary increases (decreases) in stock prices following the announcement. The abnormal returns surrounding the announcements are economically and statistically significant. In addition, both inclusions and removals lead to temporary abnormal trading volume increases in the post-announcement period. However, the stock prices and trading volumes revert within a few trading days. Our findings are consistent with the price pressure hypothesis as the documented abnormal returns and trading volumes are not permanent.",

Our contribution is in filling this void in the literature by examining forecasted and realized earnings of firms discretionary deleted from the S&P 500 index in the period October 1989 \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009c December 2007. The study finds that contrary to the prediction of the information hypothesis the earnings forecasts and actual earnings of firms discretionary removed from the S&P 500 index on average increase.",

They further argue that because of important changes and regulations in the financial markets, like, Regulation Fair Disclosure, Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and Decimalization of the exchanges, in or after the year 2000, information asymmetry has decreased. In support of their arguments, they find that for additions, the positive abnormal returns on announcement day have decreased, and added stocks\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 liquidity changes have become marginal in the post-2000 period.

Contrary to our expectation, liquidity changes after deletion are significant in the post-2000 period.

Since market makers care more about volatilities than inventory risk, they tend to lower the bid-ask spread to mitigate volatility. This result is different from the previous argument whereby market makers tend to raise the bid-ask spread to control inventory risk. A time-varying GARCH model also confirms the results that an order imbalance does not affect volatility during self-tender market convergency. We develop an imbalance-based trading strategy which is to buy (sell) according to whether order imbalances are positive (negative). The empirical findings support self-tender market efficiency.",

As an innovation we introduce a multiple criteria decision system making simultaneous use of trend indicators and other confirming indicators. By combining trend indicators with confirming indicators it is possible to build a superior technical trading strategy that captures a more comprehensive aspect of predictability in past prices. This study also proposes a test for weak form efficiency based on a combining approach. Previous approaches typically make inferences based on the empirical results of testing only one class of technical rules. Applying the combining criteria decision system the evidence suggests that the strategies proposed here have predictive ability on a data sample based on three European stocks Index Markets. Our results rejects the null hypothesis that the returns earned from applying trading rules are equal to those achieved from a naive buy and hold strategy, even after deducting transaction costs. Evidence also suggests that oscillators capture some aspect of predictability in past prices that moving averages do not detect.",

Ex ante tests are then conducted whereby ex post profitable arbitrage strategies, signified by the matched put and call contracts, are executed with lags of one minute and three minutes. The ex ante results reveal that the number of profitable arbitrage opportunities and the average profit are both reduced significantly with an execution lag. In addition, regression analysis is used to provide further evidence about the PCP and arbitrage profitability. Overall, there is no strong evidence found against the efficiency of the Nikkei 225 options market, although arbitrage opportunities do exist occasionally.",

The implication for market risk management is to underscore the need to be aware of market price fluctuation caused by implied volatility fluctuation. We found that in markets such as Japan is experiencing at the present time, in which most issues have little linkage to share price movements, there is a particular need to be aware of implied volatility in risk management. Moreover, our analysis of market characteristics found that (1) there is a significant negative correlation between implied volatility and underlying equity price fluctuation; (2) implied volatility tends to move in such a way as to reduce divergence from the historical volatility of the underlying equity price; and (3) the use o convertible bonds to raise funds during the \"bubble\" period in Japan was not necessarily an advantageous firm of financing for the issuers.",

Motivated by widely observed information leakage in the stock market and fast-growing electronic communication networks, the model features sequential information and direct order matching. I show that both the content and the dissemination speed of information are incorporated in price changes and volume accumulations simultaneously. A convergence trading strategy is proposed based on a joint statistic of price and volume, which should help to improve the timing of market entry and exit. The model offers an explanation for the mixed evidence on the relationship between price change and volume and provides several testable hypotheses.",

A key decision that a commodity style-integration investor faces at each rebalancing time is the relative weighting of the factors. We propose a Bayesian optimized style-integration (BOI) strategy with excellent out-of-sample performance. Focusing on the problem of a commodity investor that seeks exposure to the carry, hedging pressure, momentum, skewness, and basis-momentum factors, the evidence suggests that the BOI portfolio achieves better Sharpe ratios and certainty equivalent returns, among other performance metrics, than the 1/K style-weighted integrated portfolio, and a battery of sophisticated optimized integrations.

The results show that the interdependence between equity indices and precious metals markets is contingent on the state of the market (bear, bull, or normal) and the horizon of frequency domains. Of all precious metals, the diversification benefits from gold, followed by silver, are consistently the highest for SP500 and STOXX50 and the least with palladium in most cases. The same holds when we investigate the diversification potential of precious metals for industrial sectors in the US and UK. A quantile frequency connectedness approach reveals that the diversification potential of precious metals diminishes in the long frequency horizon as coherence with stock indices becomes highly positive. The connectedness between stock indices and precious metals is high during market extremities but dampens as the market attains stability. At the same time, connectedness increases during periods of financial turmoil across all frequencies. We also document a change in the diversification role of precious metals during COVID-19.",

In this study, we propose a statistical method to see when and how fast the intraday price discovery progresses using the high frequency price series on a daily basis. The proposed method consists of estimating three candidate models which gauge the different types of price discovery progress, i.e. no progress, smooth progress and abrupt progress, and selecting the most appropriate model based on Bayesian approach. We conduct simulation analysis to assess the performance of our proposed method and confirm that the method depicts the state of price discovery appropriately.

We do a Principal component analysis to convert these indicators to a single indicator representing the market efficiency. Then we try to find the co-movement among different measures through correlation coefficient and among different stocks through OLS regression: market efficiency values of individual stocks are regressed on market efficiency values of CSI 300 for seven measures respectively. We found that different market efficiency measures are indeed consistent to each other to some extent and the individual stocks are somewhat consistent with the whole market indicating there is a systematic market efficiency in stock market in China. Our finding also support the idea that the market efficiency in Chinese stock market is changing all time without showing a clear upward trend from 2005 to 2020. In the end, we set three hypotheses to explain relatively high level of market efficiency in 2005, 2012, 2017 and 2019: the ability of market detecting and reacting to pricing errors, public information or private information is becoming quickly and accurately. We found that when the market is in a bad condition, the market contains more pricing-errors in daily returns and the ability of market detecting and reacting to private information is also bad.",

Therefore, the expected illiquidity premium displays strong state-dependent variations that are countercyclical.

        "abstract": "This paper examines how the informational efficiency of the Japanese stock markets changed with the introduction of ETFs(Exchange-Traded Funds) by looking at the arbitrage relationships between cash and futures of the Nikkei225. This paper is unique in that it uses tick data, which enable me to measure the degree of arbitrage by four indexes: 1) the frequency and 2) the size of the deviations from non-arbitrage condition, which reflects the magnitude of arbitrage opportunities, 3) the frequency of arbitrage transactions as a measures of the intensity of arbitrage activities and 4) the time during a deviation from non-arbitrage condition for an indicator of the achieved informational efficiency. I found that the frequency and the size of the deviations as well as the frequency of arbitrage transactions increased significantly. However, the deviation time did not change. These results suggest that while arbitrage opportunities increased, the intensified arbitrage activities balanced out it, resulting in the invariant time of deviation.",

Empirically, twofifths of the variation in book returns is due to these factors. In addition, the Daniel and Titman (2006) result is sensitive to methodological choices. When we use the change in the book value of equity as a proxy for tangible information, only the tangible component of stock returns reverses.

Moreover, most of the existing literature on ETFs did not assess the seasonality patterns of risk-adjusted returns and tracking error. This article seeks to suppress some of these gaps. The results provide evidence of a first-half of the year effect (higher returns), an outperformance of the second quarter and an underperformance of the fourth quarter compared with the remaining quarters, and higher (lower) returns in the first (third) month of the quarter vs the other months of the quarter. Furthermore, April exhibits a superior and December an inferior performance compared with the remaining months. Besides, higher (lower) returns on Wednesdays (Fridays) were observed compared with the other weekdays. Regarding the tracking error, some seasonal patterns are also reported. For example, the replication was more accurate in April than it was in remaining months and in the first month of each quarter. Finally, the effects detected in ETFs returns were not reflected in indices returns, with the exception of the April effect, indicating that the main seasonality patterns detected are caused by idiosyncratic ETFs factors and not to the constituents of the underlying indices.",

The current empirical findings on the mean returns and their volatility in the Malaysian stock market could be useful in designing trading strategies and drawing investment decisions. For instance, as there appears to be no month-of-the-year effect, long-term investors may adopt the buy-and-hold strategy in the Malaysia stock market to obtain normal returns. In contrast, to obtain abnormal profit, investors have to deliberately looking for short-run misaligned price due to varying market volatility based on the finding of day-of-the-week effect. Besides, investors can use the day-of-the-week effect information to avoid and reduce the risk when investing in the Malaysian stock market. Further analysis using EGARCH and TGARCH models uncovered that asymmetrical market reactions on the positive and negative news, rendering doubts on the appropriateness of the previous research that employed GARCH and GARCH-M models in their analysis of calendar anomalies as the later two models assume asymmetrical market reactions.",

The level of underpricing is related to retained capital, underwriter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s price support, oversubscription, listing delay and the offer price. Age of the firm, its size and the size of the offer do not seem to reduce the amount of money left on the table by issuers.

The efficiency of these expectation estimates is investigated here, for options on two major short term interest rate futures contracts traded at the LIFFE, using a long memory framework. Over the 1993 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 1997 time interval the performance of implied volatilities is not homogeneous across contracts. Information content and predictive power tests consistently suggest that implied volatility from Short Sterling contracts is more accurate as a future volatility predictor than implied volatility from 3 Month Euromark contracts. The analysis of the efficiency of the transmission of news over time and between contracts provides analogous results. Underreaction of long term volatility to changes in short term volatility is more relevant for the German interest rate contract than for the British one and Short Sterling implied volatility changes do \u00e2\u0080\u009cGranger cause\u00e2\u0080\u009d 3 Month Euromark implied volatility changes pointing to a contagion \u00e2\u0080\u0093 like interlinkage.

        "title": "The weekend trading profitability: evidence from international mutual funds",
        "abstract": "The weekend effect is described as the tendency for Monday security returns to be low (or negative) compared to other days of the week. The weekend effect may not be exploited by trading individual stocks because of transactions costs. However, the institutional characteristics of the US-based international open-end mutual funds may allow investors to exploit the weekend effect because mutual funds lack much of the transactions costs associated with individual stocks. This paper extends the study of Compton and Kunkel (1999), Varela (2002), and Miller, Prather and Mazumder (2003) by examining the weekend predictability and profitable trading opportunities for international mutual funds. The rationale behind the weekend predictability and profitability of international funds lies on the fact that the Net Asset Values (NAVs) of international funds are computed from stale prices of the underlying assets of these funds. The sample of international funds is divided into two sub-samples and the initial sub-sample is used to test the weekend effect and develop trading strategies. Returns of trading strategies are then evaluated out-of-sample and compared with the returns of a buy-and-hold strategy. Empirical findings suggest that smart investors may earn higher risk-adjusted returns by following daily dynamic trading strategies. Results also document that trading strategies based on the weekend effect produce higher risk-adjusted returns. Finally market timing models are also tested for trading strategy returns and Treynor-Mazuy and Henriksson-Merton timing measures are positive and statistically significant. Moreover, the trading rules of this study may be useful in future if fair value pricing or other institutional regularities eliminate any profitable trading opportunity based on the US market signals.",

        "abstract": "Sentiment indices based on investor sentiment surveys attempt to measure the stock market sentiment. The literature on these indices focusses mainly on whether investor sentiment influences the financial markets or not. But the term 'sentiment' has never been defined in the literature. Therefore it is unclear what is measured by sentiment indices, whether it is really sentiment or something different. This paper closes this gap in the literature by using psychological definitions about feelings to explain what might be meant by 'market sentiment'. It shows how useful these definitions are with data from the German sentiment index 'Sentix'. The paper contributes to the current discussion in three ways: 1. It presents a simple concept of sentiments in general. 2. It relates short and long term sentiment indices to two distinct parts of sentiments, emotion and mood. 3. It extracts two factors representing investor emotion and mood across all markets in the dataset. These results are stable across markets and model specifications in the Sentix dataset.",

It examines the existence of interdependence between primary and secondary market in order to test the autonomy of secondary market price behaviour.

The empirical results indicate that there is evidence of a bi-directional causality and price co-movement between the primary and secondary capital market in Greece. These findings have significant implications for the rejection of the weak form efficiency. It also provides evidence, which suggests that the announcement of issuing new stocks gives support (total or partial) to specific classes of capital structure theories. The existence of non-zero abnormal returns around the announcement periods leads to the rejection of the semi-strong EMH for the secondary market of the ASE.",

This problem arises in many statistical and fundamental arbitrage trading situations when the short-term returns on an asset are predictable but limited risk-bearing capacity does not allow to fully exploit this predictability. The model is rather simple; it does not require any inputs apart from the parameters of the price process and agent's relative risk aversion. However, the model reproduces some realistic patterns of traders' behaviour. We use the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process to model the price process and consider a finite horizon power utility agent. The dynamic programming approach yields a non-linear PDE. It is solved explicitly, and simple formulas for the value function and the optimal trading strategy are obtained. We use Monte-Carlo simulation to check for the effects of parameter misspecification.",

        "abstract": "Insider trading studies related to the German market have emphasized that outside investors may earn excess returns by mimicking the transactions of corporate directors. Such a result, provided that it holds, would constitute a serious violation of the efficient market hypothesis. The results presented in this paper, though, show that this anomaly is mainly caused by a subset of stocks with high arbitrage risk as measured by their idiosyncratic volatility. This restrains arbitrageurs from engaging in otherwise profitable and price-correcting trades. As arbitrage risk is positively related to a stock's bid/ask-spread, we show that the information conveyed by insider trades cannot be exploited in terms of generating abnormal returns once these transaction costs are taken into account. We conclude that the market's under-reaction to reported insider trades can mainly be explained by the cost associated with risky arbitrage. Our findings provide evidence that the German stock market is efficient with respect to insider trades in the sense that prices reflect publicly available information to the point where the marginal benefit of acting on information exceeds marginal costs.",

In this paper we investigate non-synchronous trading effects in terms of the predictability that may be induced in the values of stock indices. This analysis is applied to emerging-market data, on the grounds that such markets might be less liquid and thus prone to a higher degree of non- synchronous trading. We use both a daily data set and a higher frequency one, since the latter is a prerequisite for capturing intra-day variations in trading activity. When considering one-minute interval data, we obtain clear evidence of predictability between indices with different degrees of non-synchronous trading. We then propose a simple test to infer whether such predictability is mainly attributable to non- synchronous trading or an actual delayed adjustment on part of traders. The results obtained from an intra-day analysis suggest that the former cause seems a better explanation for the observed predictability. Future research in this area is needed to shed light on the degree of data predictability which may be exclusively attributed to non-synchronous trading, and how empirical results may be influenced by the chosen data frequency.",

The present paper is the first to empirically analyze whether an immediate response can be identified from the data. We use survey-based sentiment indicators from two countries (Germany and the US). Consistent with previous research we find there is predictability at intermediate time horizons. For the US, however, the predictability disappears after 1994. Using event study methodology we find that the publication of sentiment indicators affects market returns. The sign of the immediate response is the same as that of the predictability over the intermediate term.

Using survey-based sentiment indicators from Germany and the US we confirm previous findings of predictability at intermediate time horizons. The main contribution of our paper is that we also analyze the immediate price reaction to the publication of sentiment indicators. We find that the sign of the immediate price reaction is the same as that of the predictability at intermediate time horizons. This is consistent with sentiment being related to mispricing but is inconsistent with the alternative explanation that sentiment indicators provide information about future expected returns.",

        "abstract": "Previous evidence suggests that less liquid stocks entail higher average returns. Using NYSE data, we present evidence that both the sensitivity of returns to liquidity and liquidity premia have significantly declined over the past four decades to levels that we cannot statistically distinguish from zero. Furthermore, the profitability of trading strategies based on buying illiquid stocks and selling illiquid stocks has declined over the past four decades, rendering such strategies virtually unprofitable. Our results are robust to several conventional liquidity measures related to volume. When using liquidity measure that is not related to volume, we find just weak evidence of a liquidity premium even in the early periods of our sample. The gradual introduction and proliferation of index funds and exchange traded funds is a possible explanation for these results.",

        "abstract": "The often reported empirical success of trend-following technical timing strategies remains to be puzzling. In previous academic research, many authors admit some prediction power but struggle to substantiate their findings by referring vaguely to insufficient market effciency or unknown hidden patterns in asset price processes. We claim that empirical timing success is possible even in perfectly efficient markets but does not indicate prediction power. We prove this by systematically tracing back timing success to the statistical characteristics of the underlying asset price time series, which is modeled by standard stochastic processes. Five major impact factors are studied: return autocorrelation, trend, volatility and its clustering as well as the degree of market efficiency. We use trading rules based on different intervals of the simple moving average (SMA) as an example. These strategies are applied to simulated asset price data to allow for systematic parameter variations. Subsequently, we test the same strategies on real market data using non-parametric historical simulations and compare the results. Evaluation is done by an extensive selection of statistical-, return-, risk-, and performance figures calculated from the simulated return distributions.",

In particular, we analyse how specific announcements related to vulnerable Eurozone member states, European Central Bank (ECB) actions, and credit rating downgrades affect the value and the crash risk of the euro. We proxy the value changes of the euro by its abnormal foreign exchange (FX) rate returns with respect to 35 currencies. The crash risk of the euro is proxied by the conditional skewness of the FX rate return distribution with respect to the same currencies. We find that the market reacts positively to news related to countries under the European and International Monetary Fund (IMF) rescue umbrella. We discover that ECB actions on average result in a euro depreciation on the day of the announcement reflecting obvious concerns of market participants, but the effect is partly corrected the day after. Our analysis also shows that sovereign credit rating downgrades tend to lead to a depreciation of the euro and, more importantly, to an increase of the euro crash risk. Interestingly, we find that specific announcements about Greece on average do not substantially affect the euro exchange rate directly, however, it does have an overall significant effect on the euro rash risk, imposing a substantial risk for the stability of the common currency in the Eurozone.",

        "abstract": "This paper tests for the impact of survivorship bias by building on the work of Cubbin, Eidne, Firer and Gilbert (2006), and Bailey and Gilbert (2007). The former paper confirmed the existence of mean reversion on the JSE Securities Exchange, because portfolios of shares with high Price to Earnings (P/E) ratios (being those which had tended to outperform recently) underperformed significantly over five years against portfolios of shares with low P/E ratios. The latter paper developed the economic validity of this conclusion by applying liquidity constraints to portfolio formation. This tended to slightly dampen the observed effects, but confirmed the significant presence of mean reversion. In both cases, extensive efforts were made to include all delisted shares in the study to avoid the effects of survivorship bias. This paper updates both studies by extending the period for a further 21 months, and then quantifies the impact of survivorship bias by comparing the results against those of an equivalent study based on a data set of currently listed shares only. The results of our study confirm that the effects of survivorship bias are present and material. While patterns of mean reversion are detected on both data sets, the returns earned on portfolios selected from currently listed shares are significantly higher than the corresponding returns on portfolios selected from all shares. Survivorship bias is therefore confirmed to be a significant issue in such studies, which researchers should be careful to avoid; although it does not necessarily affect the conclusion of the patterns of mean reversion revealed in the earlier studies.",

Based on a large sample from 1989 to 2005, we show that the daily price response of the CRB and GSCI commodity futures indices to macroeconomic news is state-dependent. During recessions, news about higher (lower) inflation and real activity lead to positive (negative) adjustments of commodity futures prices. In contrast, we find no significant reactions during economic expansions. We attribute this asymmetric response to the state-dependent interpretation of macroeconomic news.

This paper examines two issues: whether there exists the difference of opinions of fund managers and whether there is asymmetric volatility under short-sale constraints. Under short-sale constraints, we implement testing the hypothesis of difference of opinion found by Chen, Hong, and Stein (2001) and Hong and Stein (2003). This hypothesis provides a unique opportunity to test directly the differences of opinion among fund managers that operate under short-sale constraints using asset-allocating strategies. The test results provide evidence that there is asymmetric volatility and increased differences of opinion among fund managers. Furthermore, the results of this study are consistent with the model of Hong and Stein (2003), which predicts that negative asymmetries are more likely to occur when there are large differences of opinions among fund managers. Therefore, our results imply that the overvaluation effect is more remarkable in funds for which a wider dispersion of the opinions of fund managers exists. These findings are consistent with Miller\u00e2\u0080\u0099s (1977) intuition and Hong and Stein\u00e2\u0080\u0099s (2003) model.

        "abstract": "In this thesis we deal with different topics in financial mathematics, that are all related to market imperfections and to the fundamental technique of utility maximization. The work consists of three parts. In the first one, which is based on two papers, we consider the problem of optimal investment on a financial market with proportional transaction costs. We initially study the investment problem in the case where the utility function is multivariate (which is particularly suitable on currency markets) and the agent is endowed with a random claim, which can be interpreted as an option or another derivative contract. After analyzing the properties of the primal and dual problems, we apply those results to investigate, in this context, some aspects of a popular pricing technique in incomplete markets, i.e. utility indifference evaluation. In the second contribution to the transaction costs literature, we investigate the existence problem for a set of prices (called shadow prices) that would provide the same maximal utility to the agent if the market did not have frictions. These results shed some light on the link between the classical theory of frictionless markets and the quickly growing literature on transaction costs. In the second part of this thesis we consider the utility indifference pricing problem in incomplete markets, where the source of incompleteness comes from the fact that some assets in the market cannot be actively traded, which is the case for example in the framework of structural models for electricity prices. We provide a BSDE characterization for the price under mild assumptions, and then focus on the case of European claims by establishing in particular the existence of an optimal hedging strategy even when the claim presents discontinuities and is possibly unbounded. In the last contribution we analyze a simple principal-agent problem in finite time horizon, where the principal is mainly interpreted as a regulator and the agent as a firm producing some kind of polluting emissions. We separately treat both the agent's and the principal's problems and use the BSDE theory for providing necessary and sufficient conditions for optimality. We also perform some sensitivity analyses and give numerical results in order to provide a better understanding of the agents' behavior.",

        "abstract": "The paper deals with high-frequency algorithmic trading (HFT), which has recently come to dominate some financial markets, e.g. the US equity markets. The author first attempts to establish a clear definition of high-frequency trading. With the most important characteristics having been analysed, it is concluded that such a definition would not bring more clarity into the debate over HFT. Strategies pursued by traders should be given consideration instead. On this account, the text proceeds with the examination of the most common strategies. Afterwards, the question is raised whether the rise of high-frequency algorithmic traders has resulted in more efficient financial markets. Based on robust evidence from academic research, important market participants and exchanges, HFT indeed seems to improve market quality by narrowing spreads and providing additional liquidity - the market-making strategy is mainly responsible for the latter. Issues such as possible system risks (flash crashes, herd behaviour) are also discussed.",

        "abstract": "It is well known that information arrival has an impact on prices volatility, and trading volume in financial markets (see e.g., Goodhart and O?Hara 1997). Scheduled macroeconomic announcements, such as monthly employment figures, consumer prices, or building permits, stand out from the steady flow of information.1 Several studies (e.g. Fleming and Remolona 1997) show that these releases have a very distinct impact on prices. While most of these studies try to find out which releases are significant, considerably less effort has been devoted to the question what makes some releases so important in contrast to others that seem to attract no attention. Papers addressing this question emphasize the content of releases. For example, Edison (1996) discriminates between news related to unexpected inflation and those related to unexpected changes in economic activity. Investigating intraday T-bond futures price responses to surprises in scheduled macroeconomic releases, this paper presents evidence that the type of information is relevant. More specifically, the results suggest that the sequence of releases within a given content category helps to explain their relative importance. In other words, if market participants have already observed some figures on which they can base their assessment of a particular aspect of the economy, then the additional information of another related report should be small, and thus, its impact on prices.",

We found evidence of contrarian strategies profitability for horizons from 3 months to 3 years in a sample of stock returns from BOVESPA and SOMA from 1986 to 2000. The strategies are more profitable for shorter horizons. Therefore, there was no trace of the momentum effect found by Jagadeesh and Titman (1993) for the same horizons with US data. There are remaing unexplained positive returns for contrarian strategies after accounting for risk, size, and liquidity. We also found that the strategy profitability is reduced after the Real Plan, which suggests that the Brazilian stock market became more efficient after inflation stabilization.",

The expansion of on-line financial news sources, such as internet news and social media sources, provides instantaneous access to financial news. Commercial agencies have started developing their own filtered financial news feeds, which are used by investors and traders to support their algorithmic trading strategies. In this paper we use a sentiment series, developed by TRNA, to construct a series of daily sentiment scores for Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) stock index component companies. A variety of forms of this measure, namely basic scores, absolute values of the series, squared values of the series, and the first differences of the series, are used to estimate three standard volatility models, namely GARCH, EGARCH and GJR. We use these alternative daily DJIA market sentiment scores to examine the relationship between financial news sentiment scores and the volatility of the DJIA return series. We demonstrate how this calibration of machine filtered news can improve volatility measures.",

We used the regression model proposed by Carhart (1997) with the addition of a market timing factor and analyzed the alpha coefficient sign and significance. Our results show that a significant number of managers exploit well-known strategies as size, book-to-market ratio, momentum and market timing. When we use net returns series as the dependent variable, we find that only 4.8% of active portfolios have positive and significant alphas. Active portfolio performance on average is not significantly different than passive portfolio performance. But when we run the regressions using the estimated gross returns, we found that 10.3% of active funds have positive and signi cant alphas, and on average the performance of active funds is significantly positive. Our results are in accordance with Jensen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s (1978) version of efficient market, in which asset prices reflect existing information till the moment when marginal benefits of using information do not exceed marginal costs.",

We show the bi-directional Granger causality between investor attention and cryptocurrencies (i.e., return and volatility), which is supported by linear and nonlinear Granger causality tests. The quantile regression indicates that the high investor attention is always associated with the positive return. In the overall regression analysis based on the hash algorithm, the investor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attention can significantly predict the return and return volatility. These findings show that investor attention significantly predicts cryptocurrencies, which provide implications for cryptocurrency investors.",

Past studies have exclusively used point forecasts, which are of limited value since they carry no information about the intrinsic predictive uncertainty associated. We compare empirical performances of alternative prediction intervals for stock return generated from a naive model, univariate autoregressive model, and multivariate model (predictive regression and VAR), using the U.S. data from 1926. For evaluation free from data snooping bias, we adopt moving sub-sample windows of different lengths. It is found that the naive model often provides the most informative prediction intervals, outperforming those generated from the univariate model and multivariate models incorporating a range of economic and financial predictors. This strongly suggests that the U.S. stock market has been informationally efficient in the weak-form as well as in the semi-strong form, subject to the information set considered in this study",

        "abstract": "Previous research indicates that performance and volatility of small and regional stock markets can be influenced by the performance of major world exchanges such as New York, Frankfurt or Tokyo stock exchange. This research analyses weekly composite index data for SASE (Sarajevo Stock Exchange), NYSE, NIKKEI, and DAX indices, for the period from 2008 until the end of 2012. This time period contains significant events in the US and the rest of the world, including the housing bubble, and a great recession which followed after. Significant volatility of SASE was noted in 2007 while later periods suggest lesser volatility after a significant drop in index value in mid 2007. The data was analyzed in a side by side comparison, by the method of regression in order to establish a correlation of NYSE, NIKKEI and DAX indexes with Sarajevo Stock Exchange index. Furthermore the performance was visually represented, segmented into several dynamic and steady periods, whose regressions were separately calculated, in order to see the difference in steady and dynamic periods. Previous research suggests strong correlation between regional and major stock market indices at times of crisis, a so called spillover effect, while low correlation at times of low volatility. With these results, we will be able to understand the impact of major world indices on volatility and performance movements of Sarajevo Stock Exchange in the long and short run, as well as at times of low and high volatility. The results of research suggest that when there is less dynamics in major world indices, the SASE market becomes less affected by their results and by the global market trends, thus its performance is then dictated to a higher degree by regional or country specific financial, economic and to some degree political factors. On the other hand we can also deduce that when there are significant events developing in these major world indices, SASE\u00e2\u0080\u0099s composite index performance are highly correlated to the dynamics and trends of major world indices. One such case this paper analyzed is evident in the \u00e2\u0080\u0098dynamic period\u00e2\u0080\u0099 of some 18 months, ranging from 01.01.2009-16.06.2010, where the impact of global recession on major world indexes spilled over to smaller regional exchanges; correlation between SASE and NYSE in that period is 0,92.",

However, in the last decades empirical researches revealed some anomalies in investors reactions to the events that caused shocks on the financial markets. There are two main hypotheses to describe such behaviors. The first one - Overreaction Hypothesis stipulates that investors overreact on the day when a shock occurs and they correct on the next days by opposite actions. The second one - Underreaction Hypothesis considers that investors underreact on the day of a shock and they apply corrections on the next days by opposite actions. These behaviors are influenced by the nature of events that cause shocks and by some characteristics of the financial markets. In this paper we explore the short-term reactions that followed positive and negative shocks from the Romanian capital market, using daily values of the main indexes from the Bucharest Stock Exchange for a period of time between January 2005 and March 2011. Depending on the horizons taken into consideration and on the nature of the shocks we find evidences for the Efficient Market Hypothesis, Overreaction Hypothesis and the Underreaction Hypothesis.

        "abstract": "Abstract This is the first study, to our best knowledge, that investigates the intraday volatility characteristics of the Santiago Stock Exchange. The Chilean Stock market has grown consistently over the last 40 years and is now the second largest equity market in South America behind that of Brazil. Using a recently available dataset for the most actively traded stocks, we examine the patterns of intraday volatility. We show that intraday volatility declines during the day with an accentuation at the end of trading for the stocks we examine. We document the necessity of an opening auction system for the market and justify the benefits of the proactive implementation of a closing call auction system by exchange regulators in February 2019. Showing evidence that periods of efficiency alternate with periods with lack thereof, we provide suggestions as to when different types of traders should participate during the trading session.",

The creation of the new sector had a significant impact on REITs included in the new Real Estate sector. Prior to the event date, REITs experienced significant negative returns. But after the event date, REITs also experienced significant positive returns which dissipated over time. The returns prior to (after) the event date would have resulted in a retail investor incurring losses (gains). While the magnitude of the trading volume increased noticeably prior to the event date, overall trading volume was not discernibly impacted.",

Our laboratory is Tradesports, which until 2015 operated a double auction exchange where participants traded binary options contracts. This venue is a close analog to stock markets and, because each contract\u00e2\u0080\u0099s value is unambiguously revealed, the joint hypothesis problem is mitigated. We demonstrate that when the ratio of noise traders to sophisticated traders is highest, shares are most overpriced. Data show that informed traders heavily target noise traders when liquidity is high, and in conducting profit-taking operations they prefer to short sell via small transactions and round lots. Results suggest that, even in the absence of liquidity constraints and certain costs and risks related to short selling, the relative complexity of short selling can itself lead to overpricing.",

It is found that futures followed the index in the first period, but evolved to lead the spot in the second period. Interestingly, however, futures led within 30 min of the spot\u00e2\u0080\u0099s opening in each trading day, even in the initial first period of the futures trading.

Our results are mostly consistent with economic theory and follow two general patterns: (1) a stronger-than-expected economy raises stock returns, causes the home currency to appreciate, makes the yield curve steeper, and lowers the corporate credit quality spread; (2) higher-than-anticipated inflation leads to an appreciation of the domestic currency and raises the slope of the yield curve. Surprises about retail sales, claimant count rate, GDP, and industrial production have the most prevalent effects across the four asset classes in our data set. A large number of macroeconomic announcements increase trading activity in the stock market, whereas there is barely any (only minor) evidence that announcements (surprises) affect the volatility of asset prices. We also document that the effects of macroeconomic surprises are contingent not only upon the state of the economy but also on the state of the stock market (bull vs. bear).",

We use the dataset of discussions on WallStreetBets (WSB), an online investor forum with over nine million followers as of April 2021, to show how excitement about trading opportunities can ripple through an investor community with large market impacts. This paper finds empirical evidence of psychological contagion among retail investors by exploiting differences in stock price fluctuations and discussion intensity. We show that asset discussions on WSB are self-perpetuating: an initial set of investors attracts a larger and larger group of excited followers. Sentiments about future stock performance also spread from one individual to the next, net of any fundamental price movements. Leveraging these findings, we develop a model for how social contagion impacts prices. The proposed model and simulations show that social contagion has a destabilizing effect on markets. Finally, we establish a causal relationship between WSB activity and financial markets using an instrumental variable approach.",

When including news on a set of widely followed individual macroeconomic fundamentals in the cross-section of stock returns, estimates of their prices of risk are consistent with the explanation that good news on the economy is bad news for stocks during expansions. In contrast, during contractions, good news on the economy is good news for stocks as well. We find, however, that for most macroeconomic news events, their prices of risk are estimated imprecisely due to lack of data.",

        "abstract": "The study investigated the relationship between crude oil price, and Banking Sector stock prices in Nigeria from 2009 to 2016, using quarterly data collected from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and Nigeria Stock Exchange. Index of the Nigeria stock exchange for Banking Sector index was considered as dependent variables. The study implemented nonlinear ARDL (NARDL) which is an asymmetric extension of the standard co-integration test and the standard ARDL. The NARDL was applied to determine asymmetric effect of crude oil price shocks on stock prices. Findings from the analysis indicated the presence of long-run co-integration in most cases and that positive and negative oil price shocks have differential effects on banking sector index than negative oil price shocks of the same magnitude. Oil price shocks completely transmitted to the sector. The study concluded that there should be close monitoring of the banking sectors as well as appropriate policy actions to curtail systematic risk in the sector since oil price shocks transmits to oil and gas share prices listed on the Nigeria Stock Exchange.",

This paper uses new data from an online discussion forum, Reddit, to quantify social contagion, or `hype,' in specific stock market movements, using state of the art opinion dynamics modelling and sentiment analysis. The influence between users on the WallStreetBets (WSB) subreddit is measured by tracing the probability of a user starting a fresh discussion on an asset given their previous involvement in a discussion on the same asset, measured by their comment history. This paper finds that users who comment on one discussion involving a particular asset are approximately four times more likely to start a new discussion about this asset in the future, with the probability increasing with each additional discussion the user engages in. This is a strong indication that investment strategies are reproduced through social interaction. This is further validated by findings that sentiments expressed in the linked submissions are strongly correlated in a set of spatial regression models. In particular, bearish sentiments seem to spread more than their bullish counterparts.",

Our model predicts that both investor sentiment and extrapolation impose positive effects on the stock price deviation from fundamental value, and the direction and magnitude of stock price deviation depend on the relative strength of the sentiment signal and the extrapolation signal. Futhermore, we find that the weights of the sentiment signal and the extrapolative signal are positively related to the short-term correlation of stock returns, while the lagged weight of sentiment signal negatively effects the short-term correlation of stock returns. Moreover, the model also predicts that the sentiment signal and extrapolative signal weights are positively correlated with stock volatility, and extrapolative behavior exacerbates the sentiment-driven stock volatility due to extrapolating endogenous stock returns.

We also find that press freedom may reduce the explanatory power of news reports on positive abnormal returns.

We examine the characteristics of the market by testing the fit of returns to a normal distribution using the Jarque-Bera Test, and find strong evidence against normality. The data also exhibits positive skewness and a high level of excess kurtosis. Next, we test for the presence of autocorrelation using the Ljung-Box Q Test and the non-parametric Runs Test, and find strong evidence against the null hypothesis of no autocorrelation for both of these tests. Finally, we test the associated Random Walk Hypothesis using the Augmented Dickey- Fuller Test and the Chow-Denning Multiple Variance Ratio (MVR) Test. We reject the null hypothesis of the presence of a unit root for the Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test. In addition, we find evidence against the Random Walk Hypothesis even after adjusting for the possible presence of heteroscedasticity in the MVR Test. Since all the tests present results consistent with weak-form inefficiency, we reject the weak-form of the Efficient Market Hypothesis for the Mongolian equity market.",

        "abstract": "Investors are told to be overreacting when their sentiment drives the price of a certain security up (down) enough to make it the biggest winners (loser), in most cases considering this overreaction period as long as 3 or 5 years. This paper studies the overreaction hypothesis in market indices. Using end of month data from December 1970 to December 2018 from 49 Morgan Stanley Capital International Indices we studied the overreaction hypothesis on Market Indices for 3- and 5-years\u00e2\u0080\u0099 investment periods. Instead of Cumulative Average Returns the returns were computed as Holding Period Returns to avoid the upward bias. We found strong return reversals for 3-year investment periods, which were statistically significant at a 5% significant level. However, the returns might be weaker depending on the time period we consider. When implemented only in developed markets there is still evidence which supports the overreaction hypothesis, although the excess returns are economically weaker. Evidence for the overreaction hypothesis was also found when 5-year investment periods were considered. Not only did losers outperform winners, but they were also less risky than winners. Regardless of the market, investment period and/or time-period considered, losers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 portfolio beta was always smaller than the winners\u00e2\u0080\u0099 portfolio beta.

However, the importance of information about the US economy may vary in time. In order to analyze this issue, we examine the impact of announcements of unexpected US macroeconomic news on the prices of selected stocks listed on the Vienna Stocks Exchange. On the basis of the 5-minute returns of 13 stocks we examine how the strength and the significance of the reactions of investors to unexpected macroeconomic news from the US has changed over the last 15 years. Event study methodology allows us to describe precisely such reactions in the first minutes after news announcements.",

It aims to reveal whether trading on historical information about stock prices or indices may lead to economically significant abnormal profits and whether the analyzed markets are comparably efficient. It also tests relative efficiency of the Central European markets compared to developed capital markets that are considered the most effective - the American NYSE, German and Netherlands stock exchanges. Complexity of the results is enhanced by analyzing daily, weekly and monthly returns of both the major regional indices - the Czech PX-50 and PX-D, Hungarian BUX and Polish WIG20 - and individual shares that constitute the indices. Moreover, consequences of the non-synchronous trading for autocorrelations are discussed. In conclusion, the Central European region must be considered as a heterogeneous market. While the Hungarian market generally complies with the hypothesis and behaves weakly efficient, significant linear dependences are typical for the Czech stock market. Some unsystematic departures from the random walk model persist in Poland and the efficiency market hypothesis can not be validated there. Any abnormally profitable investment strategy that exploits technical analysis should thus avoid Hungarian stocks and exploit short-term dependences on the Czech and, to a lesser extant, Polish stock market.",

A major contribution of this paper is the construction of a monetary-policy surprise measure for the Philippines, as the difference between the actual change in the monetary policy rate and the change anticipated by professional forecasters. My results are consistent with the literature, suggesting that unanticipated monetary policy changes exert a significant influence on stock prices in the Philippines. Overall, I find that an unexpected increase of 25 basis points in the monetary policy rate increases stock prices by about 1.09% on average. These results are robust to the inclusion of additional control variables in the baseline regression model, such as the implementation of restrictions to economic activity to curb the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak or revisions to macroeconomic forecasts released concomitantly with the monetary-policy rate announcement.",

The premise for this research follows from the notable increase in assets under management of index tracker funds both globally and locally, in recent years. A larger asset base tracking a given index would imply larger volumes of forced buying and selling by passive tracker funds when changes are made to the constituents underlying the index. This follows as the passive trackers are tracking error sensitive as opposed to being price sensitive, which should lead to predictable excesses in demand for stocks entering and supply of stocks exiting the index. The objective of this research is to uncover whether these dynamics result in price distortions in the local index, and in particular whether it can be profitably exploited by front-running anticipated changes. Our study indeed confirms the existence of a highly profitable index effect, conditional upon timing trading actions correctly and being able to accurately predict entrants and deletions ahead of the public announcement.",

Daily closing price of Bitcoin between 04/2013-01/2019 were obtained from coinmarketcap. The fractal nature of Bitcoin market is tested with R/S, DFA, Periodogram and GPH models. The Hurst exponents show that FMH is valid in the Bitcoin market. Additionally, the effect of financial bubble formation and structural breaks on fractality is investigated through the ARFIMA-FIGARCH and ARFIMA-HYGARCH models.

Results indicate that beginning of the conflict in late February brought a very strong significant price correction and stock markets in the examined countries became maximum oscillatory and subjected to light and rapid changes on a daily level. The findings contribute to the research on economic impact of the armed conflict by providing empirical evidence that conflict between two European (Non-European Union members) countries has spill-over effects on stock markets on other European (European Union members and Non-European Union members) countries.

They are a source of capital and such an anomaly as underpricing could be a barrier for development of young companies. It means so-called money left on the table, which constrain the effectiveness of the market. The purpose of the paper is to analyze whether lower entry regulations on the European Alternative Investment Markets are correlated with the higher value of underpricing as the demonstration of higher investing risk. We calculate raw initial returns with different equilibrium prices for three European Alternative Investment Markets and confirm that NewConnect, the market with the lighter legal environment, has the highest initial returns for the first day of trading, however after one month returns turn out to be significantly lower than on the other two markets and differs for aftermarket rate of returns. Our results suggest that there is a premium for higher risk on NewConnect, but only after one month rate of returns turn out to be negative, which can suggest that market participants verify very quickly the quality of issuers.",

We have employed the standard event study methodology on a sample of stocks listed on the National Stock Exchange of India for the purpose of our study. We observe that the market reaction to firm specific corporate news varies according to the type of news across different industry groups.

        "title": "Systematic Mispricing in European Equity Prices?",
        "abstract": "One empirical argument that has been around for some time and that clearly contra- dicts equity market efficiency is that market prices seem too volatile to be optimal estimates of the present value of future discounted cash flows. Based on this, it is deduced that systematic pricing errors occur in equity markets which hence can not be efficient in the Effcient Market Hypothesis sense. The paper tries to show that this so-called excess volatility is to a large extend the result of the underlying assumptions, which are being employed to estimate the present value of cash flows. Using monthly data for three investment style indices from an integrated European Equity market, all usual assumptions are dropped. This is achieved by employing the Gordon Growth Model and using an estimation process for the dividend growth rate that was suggested by Barsky and De Long. In extension to Barsky and De Long, the discount rate is not assumed at some arbitrary level, but it is estimated from the data. In this manner, the empirical results do not rely on the prerequisites of sta- tionary dividends, constant dividend growth rates as well as non-variable discount rates. It is shown that indeed volatility declines considerably, but is not eliminated. Furthermore, it can be seen that the resulting discount factors for the three in- vestment style indices can not be considered equal, which, on a risk-adjusted basis, indicates performance differences in the investment strategies and hence stands in contradiction to an efficient market. Finally, the estimated discount rates under- went a plausibility check, by comparing their general movement to a market based interest rate. Besides the most recent data, the estimated discount rates match the movements of market interest rates fairly well.",

The observed daily patterns differ for local and dollar returns, the latter being exhibiting lower daily means and higher standard deviations. In local currency terms, a pattern of higher returns around the middle of the week, Tuesday and then Wednesday; and a lower pattern towards the end of the week, Thursday and then Friday, are observed. In dollar terms, a higher pattern occurs around the middle of the week, Wednesday and then Tuesday; and a lower one is observed towards the end of the week, Thursday and then Friday. The lower patterns are more apparent in both cases. Volatility is the highest on Mondays in both local and dollar returns. Local returns have the lowest volatility towards the end of the week, Thursday and Friday, whereas the lowest volatility of dollar returns are observed on Tuesdays.

One proposition that seems to contradict this is Shiller's finding of excess volatility in asset prices and its resulting rejection of the discounted cash flow model. This paper replicates Shiller's approach for a different data set and extends his analysis by testing for a long-run relationship by means of a cointegration analysis. Contrary to previous studies, monthly data for an integrated European stock market is being used, with special attention to equity style investment strategies. On the basis of this analysis' results, Shiller's findings seem questionable. While a long-run relationship between prices and dividends can be observed for all equity styles, a certain degree, but to a much smaller extent than in Shiller's approach, of excess volatility cannot be rejected. But it seems that a further relaxation of Shiller's assumptions would completely eliminate the finding of an overly strong reaction of prices to changes in dividends. Two interesting side results are, that all three investment styles seem to have equal performance when adjusting for risk, which by itself is an indication for efficiency and that market participants seem to use current dividend payments from one company as an indication for future dividend payments by other firms. Overall the results of this paper lead to the conclusion that efficiency cannot be rejected for an integrated European equity market.",

        "abstract": "The aim of this study is to provide a comprehensive description of the dependence pattern of stock returns by studying a range of quantiles of the conditional return distribution using quantile autoregression. This enables us in particular to study the behavior of extreme quantiles associated with large positive and negative returns in contrast to the central quantile which is closely related to the conditional mean in the least-squares regression framework. Our empirical results are based on 30 years of daily, weekly and monthly returns of the stocks comprised in the Dow Jones Stoxx 600 index. We find that lower quantiles exhibit positive dependence on past returns while upper quantiles are marked by negative dependence. This pattern holds when accounting for stock specific characteristics such as market capitalization, industry, or exposure to market risk.",

        "abstract": "We examine large price changes, known as jumps, in the U.S. Treasury market. Using recently developed statistical tools, we identify price jumps in the 2-, 3-, 5-, 10-year notes and 30-year bond during the period of 2005-2006. Our results show that jumps mostly occur during prescheduled macroeconomic announcements or events. Nevertheless, market surprise based on preannouncement surveys is an imperfect predictor of bond price jumps. We find that a macroeconomic news announcement is often preceeded by an increase in market volatility and a withdrawal of liquidity, and that liquidity shocks play an important role for price jumps in U.S. Treasury market. More importantly, we present evidence that jumps serve as a dramatic form of price discovery in the sense that they help to quickly incorporate market information into bond prices.",

The analysis suggests two important findings. First, foreign investors do not consider the market portfolio of domestic securities as predicted by standard theories of international portfolio diversification. Second, the firm's size and the expected return are central to explain foreign investors' equity trades. The results are consistent with models based upon the hypothesis of differential information between foreign and domestic investors.",

The literature also shows that heterogeneous private information contributes significantly to price discovery for U.S. Treasury securities. In this paper, we use high frequency transaction data for 2-, 5-, and 10-year Treasury notes and employ a Markov switching model to identify intraday private information flow in the U.S. Treasury market. We show that the probability of private information flow (PPIF) identified in our model effectively captures permanent price effects in U.S. Treasury securities. In addition, our results show that public information shocks and heterogeneous private information are the main factors of bond price discovery on announcement days, whereas private information and liquidity shocks play more important roles in bond price variation on non-announcement days. Most interestingly, our results show that the role of heterogeneous private information is more prominent when public information shocks are either high or low. Furthermore, we show that heterogeneous private information flow is followed by low trading volume, low total market depth and hidden depth. The pattern is more pronounced on non-announcement days.",

To understand the mechanisms driving this result, we evaluate the relative importance of stock connections through common brokers (who provide margin financing) versus common margin traders. We find that common brokers are most important. Margin-eligible stocks that are more connected through common brokers experience larger crisis-period increases in pairwise return comovement, especially when those brokers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 clients have experienced recent portfolio losses, when their clients have outstanding margin loans in more volatile stocks, and when the brokers are large.

The return predictability is more significantly driven by document, light, and business-to-business parcels, which reflects the intensity of a firm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s overall operations (rather than just sales growth), and by parcels sent to new addresses, which represents new business expansion.

Domestic retail investors have a greater presence in Chinese A shares and foreign institutions are relatively more prevalent in B shares. These differences result from currency conversion restrictions and mandated investment quotas. We find that only B shares exhibit momentum and earnings drift and only A shares exhibit monthly reversals. Institutional ownership strengthens momentum in B shares. These patterns accord with a setting where short-term reversals (which represent inventory risk premia) prevail in a market dominated by noise traders and momentum prevails in markets where noise traders are less prevalent relative to informed investors who underreact to fundamental signals.

Even though I empirically show that index changes are predictable, they still earn sizeable post-announcement 1-day abnormal returns up to 1.42% and \u00e2\u0088\u0092 1.54% for promotions and demotions, respectively. While abnormal returns are larger in smaller stocks, I find no evidence that they are related to funding constraints or additional risk for trading on wrong predictions. A trading strategy that trades according to my model yields an annualized Sharpe ratio of 0.83 while being invested for just 4 days a year.",

Next, the article focuses on the period after 2020, and applies the event study methodology in order to establish, how the two cryptocurrencies with the highest market capitalization (Bitcoin and Ethereum) reacted to selected events. These events mainly encompassed hacker attacks aimed at the systems that form the basis of the operation of cryptocurrencies, and also certain steps regarding their regulation and application. Overall, it was established that hacker attacks did not have a significant effect on the exchange rates of the two examined cryptocurrencies. Effects of regulatory action on prices are mixed, however even significant effects can be regarded as short-lived.",

This was due to a fall in production \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009c especially in Gujarat. To examine the performance of the Jeera futures market and its efficiency, econometric models, specifically Johansen\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s Co-integration, the Vector Error Correction Model, the Impulse Response and the Variance Decomposition, are used on data from 2005 to 2019 from the NCDEX. The analysis revealed a longterm correlation between spot and futures prices, demonstrating that futures contracts are a viable hedging tool. Information flows unidirectionally from spot markets to future markets. Both markets undergo error correction to restore market equilibrium. The Granger causality test is utilised to assess the causal connection between future and spot prices. The augmented GARCH model was utilised to examine the contemporaneous relationship between spot volatility and unexpected futures trading activity, and the Granger Causality test was utilised to determine causality.

Indeed, a strategy of shorting stocks with a disproportionate number of negative picks on the site and buying stocks with a disproportionate number of positive picks produces a return of over nine percent per annum over the sample period.

Despite their fundamental importance, these questions are among the most controversial issues in finance. In this paper, we use a novel data set that allows us to directly measure the level of disagreement among Wall Street mortgage dealers about prepayment speeds. We examine how disagreement evolves over time and study its effects on expected returns, return volatility, and trading volume in the mortgage-backed security market. We find that increased disagreement is associated with higher expected returns, higher return volatility, and larger trading volume. These results imply that there is a positive risk premium for disagreement in asset prices. We also show that volatility in and of itself does not lead to higher trading volume. Rather, it is only when disagreement arises in the market that higher uncertainty is associated with more trading. Finally, we are able to distinguish empirically between two competing hypotheses regarding how information in markets gets incorporated into asset prices. We find that sophisticated investors appear to update their beliefs through a rational expectations mechanism when disagreement arises.",

Since Roll's (1988) provocative presidential address that showed little relation between stock prices and news, however, the finance literature has had limited success reversing this finding. This paper revisits this topic in a novel way. Using advancements in the area of textual analysis, we are better able to identify relevant news, both by type and by tone. Once news is correctly identified in this manner, there is considerably more evidence of a strong relationship between stock price changes and information. For example, market model R-squareds are no longer the same on news versus no news days (i.e., Roll's (1988) infamous result), but now are 16% versus 33%; variance ratios of returns on identified news versus no news days are 120% higher versus only 20% for unidentified news versus no news; and, conditional on extreme moves, stock price reversals occur on no news days, while identified news days show an opposite effect, namely a strong degree of continuation. A number of these results are strengthened further when the tone of the news is taken into account by measuring the positive/negative sentiment of the news story.",

Second, we use a present-value model to decompose the cross-sectional variance of firms' price-to-book ratios into two components due to risk-adjusted fundamental value and mispricing.

Our analysis of the trading activity in five major U.S. cities over a six-year period finds vistually no difference in individuals propensity to buy or sell equities on cloudy days as opposed to sunny days. If the association between cloud cover and stock returns documented for New York and other world cities is indeed caused by investor mood swings, our findings suggest that researchers should focus on the attitudes of market-makers, news providers or other agents physically located in the city hosting the exchange. NYSE spreads widen on cloudy days. When we control for this, the significance of the weather effect is dramatically reduced.

Intertemporal asset pricing theory suggests that the former should have a higher price of risk; thus beta, like cholesterol, comes in bad' and good' varieties. Empirically, we find that value stocks and small stocks have considerably higher cash-flow betas than growth stocks and large stocks, and this can explain their higher average returns. The poor performance of the CAPM since 1963 is explained by the fact that growth stocks and high-past-beta stocks have predominantly good betas with low risk prices.",

We use a new and comprehensive sample of options on individual stocks in combination with a measure of the cost and difficulty of short selling, specifically the spread between the rate a short-seller earns on the proceeds from the sale relative to the standard rate (the rebate rate spread). We find that violations of put-call parity are asymmetric in the direction of short sales constraints, their magnitudes are strongly related to the rebate rate spread, and they are maintained even in the presence of transactions costs both in the options and equity lending market. These violations appear to be related to both the maturity of the option and the level of valuations in the stock market, consistent with a behavioral finance theory that relies on over-optimistic investors in the stock market and segmentation between the stock and options markets. Moreover, the extent of violations of put-call parity and the rebate rate spread for individual stocks are significant predictors of future stock returns. For example, cumulative abnormal returns, net of borrowing costs, over a 2\u00c2\u00ab-year sample period can exceed 65%.",

The remaining dispersion can be explained by expected 15-year profitability and persistence of valuation levels. Furthermore, this fraction appears stable across time and across types of stocks.

Accruals (the difference between accounting earnings and cash flow) are reliably, negatively associated with future stock returns. Earnings increases that are accompanied by high accruals, suggesting low-quality earnings, are associated with poor future returns. We explore various hypotheses -- earnings manipulation, extrapolative biases about future growth, and under-reaction to business conditions -- to explain accruals' predictive power. Distinctions between the hypotheses are based on evidence from operating performance, the behavior of individual accrual items, and discretionary versus nondiscretionary components of accruals.",

For that purpose, several investment strategies conditioned by the identification of the Head and Shoulders pattern (in its basic and inverted forms) by a computer algorithm in daily price series of 30 stocks from January 1994 to January 2009 were defined. Confidence intervals consistent with the null hypothesis that no strategies with positive returns can be based only on historical data were constructed using the Bootstrap sample inference technique in order to test the predictive power of each strategy. More specifically, the mean returns obtained by each strategy when applied to the stock\u00e2\u0080\u0099s price series were compared to those obtained by the same strategies when applied to 1.000 artificial price series - for each stock - generated in a parametric manner, by an E-GARCH, and in a nonparametric one. Overall, our results show that it is possible to create strategies conditioned by the occurrence of Head and Shoulders, with positive returns, which indicates that these patterns can capture from stock historical prices some signals about their future price trend that makes possible to create profitable strategies. Nevertheless, the same conclusions are not valid for the pattern in its inverted form and when the effects of taxes and transaction costs are considered, depending on their magnitude, neither in its basic form.",

In this paper, we instead use measures of institutional and retail demand for information. We show that institutional demand for information is associated with increased trading volume and significant price movements. Average returns and betas are higher on days with higher institutional demand for information. The magnitude of these effects is much larger than those associated with the supply of news. However, the impact of demand for information from retail investors, while statistically significant, is quite small in magnitude. We also show that higher institutional demand alleviates mispricing in the market. In particular, higher information processing by institutional investors dampens momentum and enhances long-term reversals. As such, when demand for information increases, the market becomes more efficient.",

Consistent with the behavioral models, the results show that (1) measures of dispersion are negatively related to subsequent market excess returns, (2) this negative relation is more pronounced among riskier firms, and (3) dispersion is positively related to aggregate trading volume, idiosyncratic volatility, and investor sentiment, and increases after good past market performance.",

Using the event study method, the speed of reaction of the market to annual earnings information releases for a sample of 16 firms listed on the exchange is tested. Significant abnormal price reactions around earnings announcements suggest the earnings announcements contain value-relevant information. We find that the magnitude of the cumulative abnormal returns is dominated by significant reactions 20 days before the earnings release date which suggests that a portion of the market reaction may be due to private acquisition and, possibly, abuse of information by insiders. The persistent downward drift of the cumulative abnormal returns, 20 days after the announcement, is inconsistent with the efficient markets hypothesis, and therefore suggests that the Nigerian stock market does not efficiently adjust to earnings information for the sample firms within the study period.",

The contribution lies in the application of multiple measures of herding. Results indicate that FIIs exhibit PFT behaviour in equity and to some extent, in debt. At the individual stock level, FIIs herd during non-extreme market conditions, but market-level measures indicate absence of herding in extreme market conditions. In the bullish market, they behave more rationally compared to bearish or normal market conditions.",

        "abstract": "The aim of this paper is to explain the phenomenon of distortions in the foreign exchange market. Distortions in the sense of (lasting) deviations of the exchange rate from its fundamental value are a sign of market inefficiency. One well known example for such a phenomenon is the bubble path of the US Dollar in the eighties. The starting point for our investigation is a chartists-fundamentalists model. Motivated by empirical observations a model is developed where boundedly rational market participants choose at the beginning of each new trading period between a technical and a fundamental trading rule to determine their speculative investment positions. If one subscribes to the strong assumption that the agents are able to figure out the true fundamental value of the exchange rate, then the exchange rate fluctuates in a complex way around its fundamental value and the foreign exchange market is more or less efficient. However, the contribution of this paper is to model the perception process of the fundamental exchange rate more realistically on the grounds of psychological evidence. Within this framework forces which influence the distortion are analysed: While the agents follow the news arrival process closely, mistakes in the information processing occur. These mistakes are propagated over time since the agents tend to stick to their previously perceived fundamental value (anchor heuristic). Moreover, if the agents belief that the spot exchange rate itself contains relevant information and thus incorporate it into their \"anchor\", the exchange rate becomes even more disconnected with its true fundamental. Nevertheless, in the long run the agents react to macroeconomic imbalances and thus adjust their perception. By this learning procedure, the distortion eventually is corrected and some long-term mean-reversion sets in. Note that the results are not the outcome of curious exchange rate fluctuations but that the generated time series shares some basic stylized facts with the empirical data. For instance, the model possesses the property of a non stable, fat-tailed distribution of the returns.",

In addition, we show that complementary empirical factors\u00e2\u0080\u0094size and ratio of the book-to-market value of equity\u00e2\u0080\u0094that are sometimes presented as potential remedies to beta\u00e2\u0080\u0099s deficiencies do not seem to outperform beta.

Announcements of important publicly available macroeconomic news essentially increase the number of causal relationships on the markets and between them. Granger causality tests confirm the dominant role of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. Causality running from DAX returns to returns of ATX and WIG20 is statistically significant irrespective of the time of day and the presence of important macroeconomic news announcements.

We find a statistically significant relationship between investor sentiment and Bitcoin returns for frequencies of up to 15 minutes. For lower frequencies, the relation disappears. We also find that the impact of sentiment on returns is concentrated on the period around the Bitcoin bubble. However, the magnitude of the effect is rather small making it impossible for a trader to make economic profits by trading on the information published on social media.",

Motivated by empirical observations a chartists-fundamentalists model is developed in which boundedly rational agents repeatedly choose between technical and fundamental trading rules to determine their speculative investment positions. Crucial for the dynamics is how the traders perceive the fundamental exchange rate. This perception process is based on psychological evidence. Simulations give rise to bubbles but simultaneously display quite realistic exchange rate dynamics (unit roots in the exchange rates, fat tails for returns, and volatility clustering).",

We confirm that algorithms react faster and more correctly to announcements than non-algorithmic traders. During the initial surge in trading activity in the first 90s after the announcement, algorithms time their trades better than non-algorithmic traders, hence algorithms tend to be profitable, while non-algorithmic traders make losing trades over the same time period. During the pre-announcement period, non-algorithmic volume imbalance leads algorithmic volume imbalance, however, in the post announcement period, the direction of the lead\u00e2\u0080\u0093lag association is exactly reversed.

Our evidence suggests that these two kinds of sentiment measures do not correlate well with one another. For a short 2 - 4 year period in which we have direct investor sentiment survey data from UBS/Gallup, only the consumer confidence correlates well with investor sentiment. Further, only the consumer confidence based measure can robustly explain the small-firm return spread and the return spread between stocks held disproportionately by retail investors and those held by institutional investors. Surprisingly, there is even a hint that the consumer confidence measure can explain closed-end fund IPO activity, while the CEFD cannot. In sum, our evidence supports the view that sentiment plays a role in financial markets, but that the CEFD may be the wrong measure of sentiment.",

I start by summarizing the evidence on cross-sectional return predictability and the failure of standard (consumption) CAPM models and their conditional versions to explain these predictability patterns. One response in part of the recent literature is to focus on ad-hoc factor models, which summarize the cross-section of expected returns in parsimonious form, or on production-based approaches, which suggest links between firm characteristics and expected returns. Without imposing restrictions on investor preferences and beliefs, neither one of these two approaches can answer the question why investors price assets the way they do. Within the rational expectations paradigm, recent research that imposes such restrictions has focused on the ICAPM, long-run risks models, as well as frictions and liquidity risk. Approaches based on investor sentiment have focused on the development of empirical proxies for sentiment and for the limits to arbitrage that allow sentiment to affect prices. Empirical work that considers learning and adaptation of investors has worked with out-of-sample tests of cross-sectional predictability.",

Our research rigorously calculates static and dynamic higher-order moment spillovers across nine distinct US industries, using ultra-high-frequency data. We dive into the complex factors driving these spillovers, examining micro and macro-level factors. Our findings illuminate how higher-order moments are transmitted among these industries, particularly during disruptive global events with time-varying patterns. Notably, we discover that crash risk's persistence surpasses that of volatility risk, highlighting a significant divergence in market agents' asset pricing mechanisms. Importantly, firm-level risk factors significantly influence crash risk, showing an inverse relationship with industry-specific uncertainty. On the other hand, external macro-level risk factors directly impact the realized volatility of these industries. Our study's insights have substantial implications for various stakeholders, including investors, fund managers, policymakers, and financial regulators.",

The same conclusions are made when replacing win/loss dummies with unexpected win (loss) variable and sorting portfolio returns by market capitalization, past returns and volatility.

The price impact models imply that abnormal returns to portfolio strategies decline with portfolio size. We calculate break-even fund sizes which lead to zero abnormal returns. In addition to commonly studied equal- and value-weighted momentum strategies, we derive a liquidity-weighted strategy designed to reduce the cost of trades. Equal-weighted strategies perform the best before trading costs and the worst after trading costs. Liquidity-weighted and hybrid liquidity/value-weighted strategies have the largest break-even fund sizes: conservatively, $5 billion or more (relative to December 1999 market capitalization) may be invested in these momentum-based strategies before the apparent profit opportunities vanish.",

Cointegration tests are used and an error correction model is developed in order to examine the relationship between price movements of FTSE/ASE-20 three-month futures index and the underlying cash market in Athens Stock Exchange (ASE). \u00c3\u0094he investigation of its price discovery mechanism has been motivated by the existing paucity of similar research in such newly established (emerging) futures markets and the growing importance of this market for both investors and the Greek capital market. The results show the presence of a bi- directional causality between stock index spot and futures markets, indicating that the newly established ADEX can provide futures contracts that serve as a focal point of information assimilation and fulfil their price discovery.",

We also examine the sensitivity of the wavelet-based unit root test. Our wavelet-based unit root tests show evidence that rejects the null of the unit root for all of the BRICS countries except for the Russian Federation. Hence, the tests provide support for the predictability of stock market indices in these economies on the basis of historical information. However, there is a need for caution because the results are based on a relatively small sample of only 11years of monthly observations.",

Based on the misvaluation measure, we form a misvaluation factor and find that stock return covariances with this factor possess significant and robust return predictive power.

HotCopper is the largest online stock message board in Australia and the sample of messages covers over 2000 companies listed on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) from January 2003 through December 2008. We exclude messages surrounding public price-sensitive announcements released centrally by the ASX in order to examine the private information content of internet board messages. We find that the number of board messages and message sentiment significantly and positively relate to the contemporaneous returns of underperforming (low ROE, EBIT margin, EPS) small capitalization stocks with high market growth potential (low book-to-market). Posting activity is positively associated with trading volume for small stocks and negatively associated with bid-ask spreads for small and large stocks in the short term. Bullish small stocks outperform bearish ones significantly in respective days and months, exhibiting no return reversals to pre-message board activity levels in subsequent time periods. Large stocks are not found to be affected by message board activity. We conclude that higher message board activity quickly reflects itself into the prices of small capitalization stocks in a highly regulated market like the ASX.",

As expected, we find higher adverse selection costs around the arrival of newswire messages. Negative messages are associated with higher adverse selection costs than positive or neutral messages. Liquidity increases around positive and neutral messages and decreases around negative messages. Available order book depth as well as the trading intensity increases around all news.

To test our conjecture, we focus on the Chicago Fed National Activity Index (CFNAI-MA3), a single summary measure of the common factor in 85 macro variables. Our main finding is that the news component of this index does affect stock returns. The effects show up at the market level as well as at the portfolio level.

This research area is characterized by a large number of studies reflecting different markets, time periods, methodologies and model parameters. While most of the papers do find elements of predictability in markets subsequent to large price changes the wide diversity in research approaches makes it very difficult to draw general conclusions from past studies. In addition there is little consensus within the literature regarding the causes of predictability with papers variously favoring explanations based around market microstructure, behavioral anomalies and the response of market participants to changing risk. We identify the key empirical findings from the literature, evaluate the explanations for the cause of the effects, discuss the links of the research program to other areas of finance and finally review possible topics for future research in the area.",

Using a unique dataset of intraday data consisting of 2.3million block buys and 1.9million block sales, we find an asymmetry in the price impact of block purchases and sales. The asymmetry persists even when we account for the bid\u00e2\u0080\u0093ask bias in block trades, which is contrary to the previous literature. Overall, our findings suggest that in an emerging market where institutional trading is relatively scarce, market microstructure cannot explain the asymmetry in the price impact of large trades.",

We find an augmented negative relationship between MAX stocks without news and expected returns, whereby MAX with news coverage generates return momentum. The differing future return relationships between MAX stocks with and without news appears to be best explained by information uncertainty mitigation upon news arrival.

        "abstract": "Empirical studies of the information content of option prices have focused on exploring whether implied volatility contains useful information regarding the future fluctuation of underlying asset prices. If expectation formation in the option markets reflects all the currently available information regarding future price movements, option prices will be useful in forecasting the price fluctuation of underlying assets. This paper extends such an analytical framework to implied probability distribution as a whole and examines its information content by using Japanese stock price index option data (on a daily basis) from mid-1989 to mid-1996. To this end, the following questions are examined: (1) whether the implied probability distribution is a good forecast of the subsequently realized distribution of stock price fluctuations, and (2) whether a leads and lags relationship exists between stock price changes and changes in the shape of the implied probability distribution. The estimation results show that (1) the implied probability distribution contains some information regarding future price movements, but its forecasting ability is not superior to that of the historical distribution, and (2) the shape of the implied probability distribution not only responds to stock price changes but also contains some information on forecasting stock price changes. However, it should be noted that such results are highly sensitive to the choice of sample period, suggesting that the information content depends on macroeconomic and financial market conditions. Therefore, the information contained in an implied probability distribution is difficult to interpret automatically as an information variable for monetary policy, and further studies are needed on how to make use of information contained in implied probability distributions.",

The short-term traders (STT), who are the analog of the market makers in the LOB, have small trading rents and unconcentrated activity (a low Herfindahl index). In the cross-section of bonds, the low concentration is related to low spreads, low price dispersion, and small STT rents.

We also show that due to the financial and economic sanctions imposed on Russia, as well as Poland and the Czech Republic's proximity to the war zone, their currencies have weakened significantly against the USD. Furthermore, the Russian Central Bank's announcement to peg the rouble with gold, has had a significant positive impact on the pan-American, European (particularly the Russian rouble and the Polish zloty), and ME&A currencies. The analysis reveals a group of currencies that are unaffected by exogenous shocks. Incorporating these stable currencies into a portfolio would reduce the risk of volatile currencies.

We find that daily institutional trades are highly persistent and respond positively to recent daily returns but negatively to longer-term past daily returns. Institutional trades, particularly sells, appear to generate short-term losses - possibly reflecting institutional demand for liquidity - but longer-term profits. One source of these profits is that institutions anticipate both earnings surprises and post-earnings-announcement drift.

        "abstract": "Abstract We analyze the cross-sectional relation between expected idiosyncratic volatility and stock returns. The expected idiosyncratic volatility is conditioned on macro-finance factors as well as traditional asset pricing factors. The macro-finance factors are constructed from a large set of macroeconomic and financial variables. Our results show that the negative relation between expected idiosyncratic volatility and stock returns reverses to a positive one when accounting for the macro-finance effects. Portfolio analysis shows that the positive relation is economically important. The relation between expected idiosyncratic volatility and returns is not affected by business cycle variations. The empirical results are highly robust.",

(2006), this paper empirically analyzes the conditional correlation between treasury and swap markets from February 9, 2006 to May 31, 2011, and makes two key contributions. First, the dynamics of the conditional correlation of only the 2-year maturity differs from those of other maturities. These patterns might be explained by the fact that a 2-year maturity is easily affected by market forecasts of monetary policy changes by the Federal Reserve Board. Second, the financial crisis dummies (\u00ce\u00be1) are all negative in particular with significance at the 5% level for 7 year, 10 year, and 30 year maturities. This result indicates that arbitrage transactions between treasuries and swaps have not taken place on a sufficient scale during the financial crisis period. As Ito (2010) points out, market participants have been uncertain about the direction of the monetary policies of these financial institutions.",

Concerning long-run performance, investors who bought their shares in the early after-market and held them for more than three years experienced significantly lower returns than the respective industry as a whole..",

The key insight that emerges is that breadth of ownership is a valuation indicator. When breadth is low i.e., when few investors have long positions in the stock this signals that the short-sales constraint is binding tightly, implying that prices are high relative to fundamentals and that expected returns are therefore low. Thus reductions (increases) in breadth should forecast lower (higher) returns. Using quarterly data on mutual fund holdings over the period 1979-1998, we find evidence supportive of this prediction: stocks whose change in breadth in the prior quarter places them in the lowest decile of the sample underperform those in the top change-in-breadth decile by 6.38% in the first twelve months after portfolio formation. After adjusting for size, book-to-market and momentum, the corresponding figure is 4.95%.",

The model features a class of irrational investors, who underreact to the information contained in order flow, thereby boosting liquidity. In the presence of short-sales constraints, unusually high liquidity is a symptom of the fact that the market is currently dominated by these irrational investors, and hence is overvalued. This theory can also explain how managers might successfully time the market for seasoned equity offerings (SEOs), by simply following a rule of thumb that involves issuing when the SEO market is particularly liquid. Empirically, we find that: i) aggregate measures of equity issuance and share turnover are highly correlated; yet ii) in a multiple regression, both have incremental predictive power for future equal-weighted market returns.",

        "abstract": "This paper extends the smooth transition conditional correlation model by studying for the first time the impact that illiquidity shocks have on stock market return comovement. We show that firms that experience shocks that increase illiquidity are less liquid than firms that experience shocks that decrease illiquidity. Shocks that increase illiquidity have no statistical impact on comovement. However, shocks that reduce illiquidity lead to a fall in comovement, a pattern that becomes stronger as the illiquidity of the firm increases. This discovery is consistent with increased transparency and an improvement in price efficiency. We find that a small number of firms experience a double illiquidity shock. For these firms, at the first shock, a rise in illiquidity reduces comovement while a fall in illiquidity raises comovement. The second shock partly reverses these changes as a rise in illiquidity is associated with a rise in comovement and a fall in illiquidity is associated with a fall in comovement. These results have important implications for portfolio construction and also for the measurement and evolution of market beta and the cost of capital as it suggests that investors can achieve higher returns for the same amount of market risk because of the greater diversification benefits that exist. We also find that illiquidity, friction, firm size and the pre-shock correlation are all associated with the magnitude of the correlation change.",

Firms with an investment-grade rating benefit relatively more as evidenced by higher share prices and lower CDS spreads, which reflects that the ECB is restricted to purchasing investment-grade corporate debt securities. The gains to shareholders relative to the total gains of shareholders and debtholders are negatively related to firm leverage, consistent with the existence of debt overhang. Firms more heavily impacted by the pandemic benefit relatively little from the PEPP, which could reflect that the business models of some of these firms are heavily damaged by the pandemic. Monetary policy in the form of the PEPP and national fiscal responses to the pandemic are shown to be complements in the sense that a strong pre-PEPP fiscal response enhances the potential for the PEPP to positively affect equity and debt valuations.",

This same model also presents a way to clean up this variable so that it explains stock returns more successfully. Removing the noise from book to market in this way should improve its explanatory power under the efficient markets hypothesis, while under the alternative hypothesis of irrational pricing it should cause its explanatory power to deteriorate.

        "abstract": "The conventional view of market timing suggests an unambiguous, negative relation between equity misvaluation and the equity share in new issues-that is, firms with overvalued equity issue more equity and, all else equal, less debt. We question this conventional view in the paper. Using price pressure resulting from mutual funds' flow-induced trading to identify equity misvaluation, we first show that equity and debt prices are affected by the same shocks, but to different degrees. Next, we document substantial cross-sectional variation in the sensitivity of issuance decisions to equity misvaluation. In particular, firms with sufficient internal resources increase equity issues and yet decrease debt issues in our measure of equity misvaluation; in contrast, firms that are heavily dependent on external finance increase both equity and debt issues, to take advantage of the misvaluation in both. In sum, this paper provides evidence that equity and debt can be jointly (mis)priced, and more important, examines the resulting impact on firms' issuance decisions.",

We estimate the Treynor and Mazuy (1966) and Henriksson and Merton (1981) models augmented with the size, value, and momentum factors, either under the OLS method adjusted with the Newey\u00e2\u0080\u0093West procedure or under the GARCH(1,1)-in-mean method following the specification of Glosten et al. (1993; hereafter GJR-GARCH-M). We find that the OLS method provides little evidence in favour of the selectivity and timing ability, consistent with previous studies. Interestingly, the GJR-GARCH-M method reverses this result, showing some relatively strong evidence on favourable selectivity ability, particularly for international funds, as well as favourable timing ability, particularly for domestic funds. We conclude that the GJR-GARCH-M method performs better in evaluating fund performance compared with the OLS method and the non-parametric approach, as it essentially accounts for the time-varying characteristics of factor loadings and hence obtains more reliable results, in particular, when the high frequency data, such as the daily returns, are used in the analysis. Our results are robust to various in-sample and out-of-sample tests and have valuable implications for practitioners in making their asset allocation decisions across different fund styles.",

Energy portfolios are important tools in most investor strategies and the way to incorporate new alternative energy companies in those portfolios has been a large part of the debate. Regardless of the strategy, be it in derivatives or traditional stock portfolios, risk anticipation and management are keys to a successful implementation. The purpose of this study, aside from filling a gap in literature, is to aid investors in risk anticipation and asset allocation through shedding some light on risk transmission effects between energy sub-sector company portfolios and energy commodities. Sub-sectors tested in this study include petroleum, coal, natural gas, solar, nuclear, wind, and biofuel companies.

The relation holds for various measures of information asymmetry such as the probability of information-based trading (PIN), permanent price impact, and adverse selection component of bid-ask spread, even after adjusting for endogeneity between news release and information asymmetry. By decomposing the PIN into intensities of uninformed and informed trades, similarly to Brown and Hillegeist (2007), we find that intensity of uninformed trading increases much more than that of informed trading for firms with more frequent news releases. As a result, information asymmetry, as is measured by PIN, decreases for such firms due to the large increase in the intensity of uninformed trading. Our findings highlight not only the importance of news releases in leveling the playing field of investors but also the role of uninformed investors in reducing trading cost due to information asymmetry.",

One interpretation of these results is that investors underreact to news about fundamentals and overreact to other shocks that move stock prices. Consistent with this hypothesis, information-based price changes are more strongly correlated with future earnings surprises than no-information ones. Furthermore, drift exists only when the direction of the price move and of the change in analyst recommendations have the same sign. Finally, the ratio of no-information to information-based price shocks is strongly correlated with aggregate implied volatility and also forecasts momentum returns.",

The speeds of adjustment in the long-run are much higher in the case of adjustments from below the threshold than from above for all the pairs. The estimates of The MTAR-VEC models suggest that the dual CDS index return in each sector pair participates in the adjustment to equilibrium in the short- and long-run taken together. But in the long-run alone, only one of the two spreads in each pair participates. Policy implications are also provided.",

This paper sheds new light by employing high frequency (5-min interval) data spanning from Jan 1, 2007 to Dec 31, 2016. Realized volatilities are estimated using Andersen et al.\u00e2\u0080\u0099s (2001) measure, while the QQ method employed is drawn from Sim and Zhou (2015). We find evidence of higher efficiency levels in the JPY and CHF currency markets. The impact of trading volume on efficiency is only significant for the JPY and CHF currencies. The GBP currency appears to be the least efficient, followed by the EUR. Implications of the results are discussed.",

We apply the relatively recent techniques of dynamic conditional correlation (DCC), asymmetric DCC (ADCC), corrected DCC (cDCC) and GO-GARCH to account for heavy tails and asymmetric returns. We use dynamic correlations to evaluate the diversification benefits of the combined portfolios with the hedging assets. The findings indicate that all the alternative assets are effective in hedging the Islamic stock portfolios compared to their conventional counterparts. The VIX shows highest hedging effectiveness for both Islamic and conventional stock portfolios. Moreover, Islamic stock indices have greater risk and downside risk-reduction benefits when mixed with the alternative assets. In sum, the development of Islamic stock indices provides alternative opportunities to diversify portfolios globally and across asset classes.",

Two different text mining methods are used to extract interpretable themes from the document set. Bank FAD press release themes emphasizing the balance of risks, effects on GDP, labour, investment, and the CPI, the terrorist attacks of 2001, and the economic effects of SARS, BSE, blackouts, and other shocks all tended to significantly reduce short-term BAX market volatility. In contrast, discussions of oil prices, the Canadian dollar, the inflation projection and whether the economy is at capacity, and certain forward looking statements significantly increased volatility. Market news stories often offset the effects of the Bank\u00e2\u0080\u0099s communication statements and were much more likely to increase market volatility while the Bank reduced it. Market stories were also more likely to have significant effects the greater the difference from the Bank news they covered but could still be important when largely replicating the original information.",

Cleaning for macro-finance effects reverses the puzzling negative relation between returns and idiosyncratic volatility documented previously.

We explain it in terms of a common cultural imprinting and the development of long-term friendship and alumni network and we directly quantify this bonding effect. We use a new dataset with information on portfolio choice ? broken down at the stock level ? wealth, income and demographic characteristics of a big panel of investors as well as information on the college they attended and their family situation at the time. We compare college-based interaction to other forms of social interaction, such as educational, professional and geographical interaction, properly controlling for all the standard motivations of portfolio theory, such as hedging of non-financial income risk, familiarity and information effects, wealth and income effect, a host of demographic, geographic and professional dummies, trend-chasing and momentum behaviour. All the different sources of social interaction significantly affect stock-picking as well as the choice between direct and delegated investment, both statistically and economically. College-based interaction is, however, the most important of them and the third single most important factor affecting stock picking. The impact of college-based interaction aggregates at the market level and affects stock prices. For each company, we construct measures of the degree of strength of college-based interaction among shareholders. We show that an increase in the strength of interaction reduces stock return and volatility. This can be rationalized in terms of recent theories on the impact of dispersion of beliefs in the presence of short-sale constraints.",

The model, extensively tested in other equity markets, implies that past movements in a stock price are not helpful in predicting future prices of that stock. The model states that changes in stock prices are serially independent and conform to some probability distribution. Conventionally, the independence part is examined through Serial Correlation Test, whereas the distributional aspect is analysed through Frequency Distributions. Same techniques are applied in this paper on daily closing prices of 36 individual stocks, 8 sector indices, and a market index from January 1, 1989 to December 30, 1993. The analysis indicates that the Random Walk Model is not valid in the Pakistani equity market as is the case in other emerging markets. The results show the presence of strong serial dependence in stock returns and indicate the slow adjustment of the market to new information. This points to the weaknesses of the market regarding the dissemination of pertinent information to potential investors, indicating that effective measures should be taken in this regard. The shape of the distribution reveals that stock returns in the Pakistani market, like in other equity markets, do not comply with the normal distribution, implying that theoretical models must be used with caution.",

        "abstract": "Abstract This paper gives the first empirical evidence on the relationships between trading volume and return volatility of the Bitcoin denominated in fifteen foreign currencies by investigating two competing hypotheses, i.e., mixture of distribution hypothesis (MDH) and sequential information arrival hypothesis (SIAH). Allowing for both linear and nonlinear correlation and causality tests, the empirical results mainly show that: first, trading volume and return volatility are negatively correlated, implying a lack of support for the MDH; second, we document significant lead\u00e2\u0080\u0093lag relationships between trading volume and return volatility, which support the SIAH; third, the results are robust to alternative measurements of trading volume, data source and sub-period analysis. Generally speaking, these findings have practical implications for investors, who are interested in investing in Bitcoin market.",

        "abstract": "We show that (electronic) designated market makers are not necessarily beneficial to the stock market during ash crashes. They actually consume liquidity when it is most needed, even if they are rewarded by the exchange to provide immediacy. This behavior exacerbates the transient price impact, unrelated to fundamentals, typically observed during a ash crash. In their place, slow traders provide liquidity, taking advantage of the discounted price. We thus uncover a trade-off between the greater liquidity and efficiency provided by designated market makers in normal times, and the disruptive consequences of their quoting/trading activity during distressed times.",

We find significant abnormal stock returns 60 trading days prior to the announcement of these switches. The results are robust after controlling for switching anticipation, rumors, other major corporate announcements, and firm performance one year prior to the switch. We also show that having a reputable Nominated Adviser (Nomad) significantly moderates the abnormal stock returns prior to market switches. However, this effect does not hold when Nomads also act as brokers in firms that switch markets. Overall, these findings provide novel evidence about abnormal stock returns prior to the announcement of market switches in the UK and the role of Nomads.

On average, higher quotation activity is associated with price series that more closely resemble a random walk, and significantly lower cost of trading. We also explore market resiliency during periods of exceptionally high low-latency trading: large liquidity drawdowns in which, within the same millisecond, trading algorithms systematically sweep large volume across multiple trading venues. Although such large drawdowns incur trading costs, they do not appear to degrade the price formation process or increase the subsequent cost of trading. In an out-of-sample analysis, we investigate an exogenous technological change to the trading environment on the Tokyo Stock Exchange that dramatically reduces latency and allows co-location of servers. This shock also results in prices more closely resembling a random walk and a sharp decline in the cost of trading.",

The negative relationship between abnormal temperature exposure and stock returns remains significant after controlling for well-known pricing factors.

However, Islamic countries rank low on the Hofstede Individualism Index, a proxy for investor overconfidence.

It hypothesizes that stock market anomalies are stronger following high sentiment if investors in Malaysia and Indonesia are overconfident. The results show that the long and short legs of the stock market anomalies earn relatively low returns following high investor sentiment, indicating overpricing during high sentiment. Moreover, the short leg earns relatively lower returns than the long leg following high sentiment because the short leg is more overpriced than the long leg when sentiment is high. Therefore, consistent with the hypothesis, the long-short returns of anomalies are stronger following high investor sentiment because of the relatively lower returns of the short leg than the long leg.",

There is an asymmetric response to news releases with negative news sentiment invoking a greater contemporaneous response in returns of gold futures. There is evidence to support the supposition that net trader positions significantly impact the identified sentiment relationship with the effect greatest when traders are holding positions contrary to their natural position; this may be explained by constraints imposed on traders in terms of credit availability, exchange imposed limits, or inventory required for physical settlement.

We find a premium of low climate risk exposure: stocks with low climate risk exposure significantly outperform those with high climate risk exposure by 0.83% to 0.90% per month in the future, on a risk-adjusted basis. Results of Fama-MacBeth regressions show that the premium of low climate risk exposure remains after controlling for well-known pricing factors. Moreover, a range of alternative settings confirms that the premium is extremely robust. Finally, climate risk exposure is a combination of pricing factors such as profitability and investment, which provides potential explanations for our results. Our study documents the importance of climate risk in cross-sectional pricing in the Chinese stock market.",

We show that target firms listed both in the secondary market of the UK, known as the Alternative Investment Market (AIM), and in the traditionally regulated Main Market, experience significant abnormal stock returns prior to takeover announcements. These results persist after controlling for market anticipation, indicating signs of information leakage. Contrary to the narrative that secondary markets may be more susceptible to market abusive behaviors, we find that the AIM targets experience significantly lower pre-announcement returns. In addition, we do not find support that the introduction of stricter laws reduces the price run-ups in any of the two markets. In sharp contrast, we find support that the enforcement of insider trading laws, through criminal convictions, reduces the pre-announcement abnormal stock returns but only in the market in which the enforcement focuses.",

We find that stock markets of the Central and Eastern Europe do not follow a random walk process. This is an important finding for the CEE markets as an informed investor can identify mispriced assets in the markets by studying the past prices in these markets. We also test the presence of daily anomalies for the same group of stock markets using a basic model and a more advanced Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity in Mean (GARCH-M) model. Results indicate that day-of-the-week effect is not evident in most markets except for some.

We show that intense aggregate individual investor buying (selling) predicts large positive (negative) abnormal returns on and after earnings announcement dates. We decompose the abnormal returns into a component that is attributed to risk-averse liquidity provision and a component that is attributed to private information or skill, and show that about half of the abnormal returns in the three months following the event can be attributed to private information. We also examine the behavior of individuals after the earnings announcement and find that they trade in the opposite direction to both pre-event returns (i.e., exhibit \"contrarian\" behavior) and the earnings surprise (i.e., exhibit \"news-contrarian\" behavior). The latter behavior, which could be consistent with profit-taking, has the potential to slow down the adjustment of prices to earnings news and contribute to the post-earnings announcement drift.",

This is due (i) to the high complexity of markets themselves, (ii) the proliferation of information flows and (iii) the difficulties in determining the effects of information on financial markets. In the current study we identify the announcements that trigger substantial changes in the behavior of the 10-year US Treasury bond market, without using the surprise component and, therefore, expectational data, which are expensive and dubious. To do so, we use a novel model-free approach based on extreme market movements. Our findings corroborate those of previous studies, which were based on expectational data.

        "abstract": "Stock returns demonstrate different levels of sensitivity to marketwide sentiment fluctuations. Previous studies argue that stock sentiment risk is caused by information opacity and that companies lacking information transparency tend to be young, small, paying no dividend, volatile, and fast growing. However, little direct evidence exists regarding the impact of information transparency on stock sentiment sensitivity/beta. This paper contributes to fill this gap by employing proximate measures of information transparency: quality of accruals and earnings, and accuracy of analyst forecast. Empirical results validate that information transparency indeed helps curb stock sentiment beta. Such an impact is more pronounced during periods of low market sentiment when irrational investors are mostly sidelined. Two mediating factors are identified: noise trading and stable institutional shareholding. Additionally, improving information transparency on corporate governance also constrains stock sentiment sensitivity. Our results are robust to alternative measures and the endogeneity concern.",

The stocks in the lowest U.S. TPU beta quintile can generate 3.48% higher annual returns compared to stocks in the highest U.S. TPU beta quintile. Furthermore, we provide two potential mechanisms that include a real economy channel and a behavioral finance channel using vector autoregression models.

By using monthly data from 1991 to 2004 and by employing GARCH (1, 1) model, it is found that macroeconomic volatility, which is measured by movement in inflation and output growth, have a weak predictive power for stock market returns and volatility in these countries. The movements of the inflation rate have significant impact to the stock market returns, either positive or negative depending on the inflation rates and their fluctuation in that country.

The main finding is that higher AIT (more specifically, insider purchases) leads to a short-run increase in stock market volatility; this can be attributed to a combination of insiders manipulating the timing and content of the information they release and the revelation of new economy-wide information to the market. The UK being a well-regulated market, it is plausible that the main driver of the increase in stock market volatility should be the information effect.

Cloud cover introduces a new uncertainty related to information quality. We measure such information uncertainty by assessing cloud cover over floating roof oil tanks.

These two effects can be explained by investor overconfidence and arbitrage costs, respectively. An investor with a mean\u00e2\u0080\u0093variance preference obtains sizable gains in terms of certainty equivalent return, which accounts for the mean effect.",

        "abstract": "Abstract It is a stylized fact that trading activity, volatility and liquidity in equity and other financial markets follow specific intraday patterns. These patterns are to a large extent determined by institutional features such as exchange trading hours or batch settlement procedures. We analyze the intraday patterns that emerge when these institutional constraints are absent. We compile a large sample of 1940 currency pairs traded on 38 cryptocurrency exchanges located on five continents. These exchanges operate 24 h a day, seven days a week, and settle trades instantly. We find that there are pronounced time-of-day patterns in trading activity, volatility and liquidity. These patterns are remarkably similar across exchanges, time zones and cryptocurrency pairs. Specifically, trading activity, volatility and illiquidity all peak between 16:00 and 17:00 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), i.e. during U.K. tea time. We find that characteristics of the exchanges (such as their locations) and of the traded currency pairs (e.g. whether two pairs share a common currency) explain some, but not all of the commonality in intraday patterns.",

Second, whether liquidity (measured by turnover ratio) enhances the momentum effect. Third, whether momentum profits exhibit reversals for illiquid stocks. Using a large sample of 3956 stocks for the period 2000 to 2021, we establish three key results. First, we find evidence of significant price momentum (intermediate and long-term) for equities listed on the BSE. Second, when conditioned on liquidity, we find that the momentum returns (short, intermediate, and long-term) are more significant for the most liquid portfolio and exhibit persistence for the next 12 months. Third, although we document evidence of short and intermediate-term reversals among the most illiquid portfolios, we fail to find evidence of persistence. Our results continue to hold after controlling for risk factors related to market premium, firm size, value, and a host of macroeconomic indicators. Taken together, our paper highlights the role of liquidity in amplifying the momentum effect in the Indian market.",

This study addresses this limitation by examining the time-varying efficiency of the two largest cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum, and the factors that drive efficiency. It uses daily data from August 7, 2016, to February 15, 2023, the adjusted market inefficiency magnitude (AMIMs) measure, and quantile regression. The results show evidence of time variation in the levels of market (in)efficiency for Bitcoin and Ethereum. Interestingly, the quantile regressions indicate that global financial stress negatively affects the AMIMs measures across all quantiles. Notably, cryptocurrency liquidity positively and significantly affects AMIMs irrespective of the level of (in) efficiency, whereas the positive effect of money flow is significant when the markets of both cryptocurrencies are efficient. Finally, the COVID-19 pandemic positively and significantly affected cryptocurrency market inefficiencies across most quantiles.",

        "abstract": "Abstract This study uses high-frequency (1-min) price data to examine the connectedness among the leading cryptocurrencies (i.e. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance, Cardano, Litecoin, and Ripple) at volatility and high-order (third and fourth orders in this paper) moments based on skewness and kurtosis. The sample period is from February 10, 2020, to August 20, 2022, which captures a pandemic, wartime, cryptocurrency market crashes, and the full collapse of a stablecoin. Using a time-varying parameter vector autoregressive (TVP-VAR) connectedness approach, we find that the total dynamic connectedness throughout all realized estimators grows with the time frequency of the data. Moreover, all estimators are time dependent and affected by significant events. As an exception, the Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0093Ukraine War did not increase the total connectedness among cryptocurrencies. Analysis of third- and fourth-order moments reveals additional dynamics not captured by the second moments, highlighting the importance of analyzing higher moments when studying systematic crash and fat-tail risks in the cryptocurrency market. Additional tests show that rolling-window-based VAR models do not reveal these patterns. Regarding the directional risk transmissions, Binance was a consistent net transmitter in all three connectedness systems and it dominated the volatility connectedness network. In contrast, skewness and kurtosis connectedness networks were dominated by Litecoin and Bitcoin and Ripple were net shock receivers in all three networks. These findings are expected to serve as a guide for portfolio optimization, risk management, and policy-making practices.",

This will allow us to explore whether the seasonal patterns usually found in global data; America, Australia, Europe and Asia. Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) is problematic as it leads to unreliable estimations; because of the autocorrelation and Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (ARCH) effects existence. For this reason Generalized GARCH models are estimated. Two approaches are followed. The first is the symmetric Generalized ARCH (1,1) model. However, previous studies found that volatility tends to increase more when the stock market index decreases than when the stock market index increases by the same amount. In addition there is higher seasonality in volatility rather on average returns. For this reason the Periodic-GARCH (1,1) is estimated. The findings support the persistence of the specific calendar effect in 19 out of 20 countries examined.",

The equilibrium third moment increases with the signal's skewness, and its magnitude increases with the signal's noisiness. Using institutional ownership and market capitalization as proxies for information precision, we find that both proxies are significantly and negatively correlated with the future absolute third moment in firm returns in China. We show that these relations are mainly driven by the negative third moment. The two proxies are positively correlated with future skewness, which contradicts the corresponding relations found in the US. Our model can reconcile the opposite findings if the US evidence is driven by positive skewness. This paper suggests that it is more appropriate to forecast positive and negative skewness separately when using information-precision proxies.",

Second, the more insider trading behaviour after equity overvaluation, the higher the merger premium and the short-term excess market return. Third, the greater the short-selling pressure after the equity overvaluation, the lower the merger premium and the weaker the short-term excess market return. Finally, this paper studies the economic consequences of M&A after equity overvaluation, and finds that M&A driven by equity overvaluation can only improve M&A performance in the current year, but cannot achieve long-term synergies. Based on the theory of M&A arbitrage, this paper studies the explanation mechanism of equity overvaluation to high-premium M&A in China's capital market, provides new evidence for executive's agency behaviour in M&A.

We estimate a vector autoregession to examine the joint behavior of returns, cash-flow news, and trading between individuals and institutions. Our main finding is that institutions buy shares from individuals in response to good cash-flow news, thus exploiting the underreaction phenomenon. Institutions are not simply following price momentum strategies: When price goes up in the absence of positive cash-flow news, institutions sell shares to individuals. Although institutions are trading in the 'right' direction, institutions as a group outperform individuals by only 1.44 percent per annum before transaction and other costs, because they are extremely conservative in deviating from the value-weight market index.",

We develop a series of cross-sectional regression specifications which attempt to forecast skewness in the daily returns of individual stocks. Negative skewness is most pronounced in stocks that have experienced: 1) an increase in trading volume relative to trend over the prior six months; and 2) positive returns over the prior thirty-six months. The first finding is consistent with the model of Hong and Stein (1999), which predicts that negative asymmetries are more likely to occur when there are large differences of opinion among investors. The latter finding fits with a number of theories, most notably Blanchard and Watson's (1982) rendition of stock-price bubbles. Analogous results also obtain when we attempt to forecast the skewness of the aggregate stock market, though our statistical power in this case is limited.",

        "abstract": "We empirically decompose the S&P 500's dividend yield into (1) a rational forecast of long-run real dividend growth, (2) the subjectively expected risk premium, and (3) residual mispricing attributed to the market's forecast of dividend growth deviating from the rational forecast. Modigliani and Cohn's (1979) hypothesis and the persistent use of the Fed model' by Wall Street suggest that the stock market incorrectly extrapolates past nominal growth rates without taking into account the impact of time-varying inflation. Consistent with the Modigliani-Cohn hypothesis, we find that the level of inflation explains almost 80% of the time-series variation in stock-market mispricing.",

Empirical results show that \"fundamental\" earning price ratios explain a significant share of cross sectional variation of the observed E/P ratios, with other additional variables being only partially and weakly relevant. Within this general framework, valid both for Europe and the US, empirical results outline significant differences between the two markets.

The response speeds are estimated with vector autoregressive models using TBI and NAREIT returns for the period 1994-2009 in the United States. To avoid the potential influence of different property mixes and of leverage on the dynamics, we use sector level data and deleveraged NAREIT returns. The findings indicate that REIT returns lead direct real estate returns even when catering for the property type and for leverage. Our estimations suggest that this lead-lag relationship is due to the sluggish reaction of direct real estate prices to unexpected changes both in the fundamentals and in REIT prices. The findings further suggest that the perceived lead-lag relations are not only due to the slow adjustment of sellers' reservation prices, but also due to the sluggish reaction of demand in the direct real estate market.",

The expansion of on-line financial news sources, such as internet news and social media sources, provides instantaneous access to financial news. Commercial agencies have started developing their own filtered financial news feeds, which are used by investors and traders to support their algorithmic trading strategies. In this paper we use a sentiment series, developed by TRNA, to construct a series of daily sentiment scores for Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) stock index component companies. A variety of forms of this measure, namely basic scores, absolute values of the series, squared values of the series, and the first differences of the series, are used to estimate three standard volatility models, namely GARCH, EGARCH and GJR. We use these alternative daily DJIA market sentiment scores to examine the relationship between financial news sentiment scores and the volatility of the DJIA return series. We demonstrate how this calibration of machine filtered news can improve volatility measures.",

We develop a comprehensive framework to investigate this link while controlling for the effects of both public information (such as macroeconomic news releases) and private information on prices and the effects of public information on volatility. Using a high-frequency 30-year U.S. Treasury bond futures data set, we find that private information variables, such as order flow and bid-ask spread, are statistically and economically significant explanatory variables for volatility. Private information is more important than public information, with the effect of a shock to order flow on volatility being four times larger than the effect of a surprise in the most influential macroeconomic news announcement. Moreover, we document an interaction between public and private information effects on volatility, with the impact of order flow on volatility depending positively on the dispersion of analysts' expectations about macroeconomic announcements. Finally, we find that the effect of private information on volatility is larger during contractions than during expansions.",

We model a market where costly participation and asymmetric information prevent latent liquidity from being expressed. At equilibrium, risk-averse insiders use preopening periods to better coordinate supply and demand of liquidity by communicating liquidity needs, thus improving welfare. Partial or full communication of private signals by the insider with the asset at preopening periods does not always enhance liquidity formation, but improves welfare through reducing adverse selection risk faced by the outsider and increasing the likelihood of her entry.

Simultaneously, but somehow independently, numerous other studies have documented the failure of the static and conditional capital asset pricing models to explain the differences in returns between value and growth stocks. This paper examines the post-1963 value premium by employing a model that captures the time-varying total risk of the value-minus-growth portfolios. In accordance with existing studies, we find that the static CAPM has no explanatory power for the value premium, and that firm size has only a limited role to play. Our results show that the conditional variance specification incorporating time-varying idiosyncratic risk can fully capture the post-1963 value premium and that the value premium is a compensation for exposure to time-varying risk. This conclusion is robust to different characteristics of value and growth stocks and to the country under review (US and UK).",

We also find that, because losers have a higher propensity than winners of disclose bad news, negative return shocks increase their volatility more than it increases that of the winners. The volatility of the losers is also found to respond to news more slowly, but eventually to a greater extent, than that of the winners. Following Hong et al.

By contrast, this paper focuses on disposal announcements, so that the impacts of listed companies' announcements and journalists' stories can be compared concerning the same events. Consistent with previous findings, negative words, rather than those expressing other types of sentiment, statistically significantly affect adjusted returns and detrended trading volumes. However, extending previous studies, the results of this paper indicate that shareholders' decisions are mainly guided by the negative sentiment in listed companies' announcements rather than that in journalists' stories. Furthermore, this effect is restricted to the announcement day. The average market reaction - measured by adjusted returns - is inversely related only when the announcements are ignored by the media, but the dispersion of market reaction - measured by detrended trading volume - is positively affected only when announcements are followed up by journalists.",

We find evidence of a significant overnight price change that diminishes the profits available to speculators although there are still profits available from the first day after announcement until a few days after the actual event. More importantly observing the tick-by-tick stock price performance of the key days of the event window for the first time, we find evidence of consistent trading patterns during trading hours over inclusion event.

Using interest rate di erentials for Uruguay over 1980-2010, we identify a strong and time-varying extrapolative component in exchange rate expectations. Agents attach more importance to the past behaviour of exchange rates the higher the level of in ation is. Yet agents are able to internalise policy announcements and external events that are likely to a ect exchange rate fun- damentals. Further, we nd deviations from the uncovered interest parity hy- pothesis. These are lower than those usually reported for developed economies. Also, they tend to be higher for the period of low in ation and freely oating exchange rates. As long as what it takes to predict well is rather simple | i.e. look backwards, follow policy announcements, the interest rate di erential per- forms well. Once the exchange rate determination model becomes more intricate or less familiar to the agents, they tend to fail at predicting exchange rate depre- ciations. These results point to expectational failures as a likely explanation for the `uncovered interest parity puzzle'.",

        "abstract": "We show that firm-level cross-asset predictability for bonds with a high incidence of informed trading is mostly driven by information diffusion. In contrast, the activities of uninformed investors dominate in originating predictability for the remaining bonds in the firm-level cross-section. Capitalizing on these results, we explore the role of informed and uninformed trading in determining the momentum effect. We find that gradual information diffusion is the main driver of short-term momentum. However, the effect of uninformed trading may outweigh that of information in generating large momentum returns, as it is the case for private-issuer bonds.",

Using daily stock prices of 36 companies, 8 sector indices, and the general market index, the AutoRegressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (ARCH) class of models was applied. The analyses suggest that one of the factors causing high serial dependence in stock returns in the Pakistani equity market is the presence of conditional heteroscedasticity or volatility in stock returns and that even after controlling for volatility the returns in the market are, in general, predictable. The results show GARCH(1,1) to be an appropriate representation of conditional variance implying that current volatility in the market is significantly affected by the past volatilities. There is also strong evidence of persistence in variance in returns implying that shocks to volatility continue for a long period. However, after accounting for the structural shift due to opening of the market, the persistence was found to decline significantly.",

Rank and sign momentum strategies are robust to the presence of extreme price movements. They generate significant profits for short-term holding periods and exhibit no long-term return reversals. More importantly, they subsume traditional price momentum, but not vice versa. In addition, rank and sign momentum strategies experience much weaker momentum crashes. Further evidence indicates that rank and sign momentum profitability is less vulnerable to salient past returns while traditional price momentum winners (losers) tend to be overvalued (undervalued) when they face a higher degree of salience.",

We document that this sentiment effect is independent of the intraday momentum effect, which is based on lagged half-hour returns. While the intraday momentum effect only exists in the last half hour, the sentiment effect persists in at least the last two hours of a trading day. From an investment perspective, high-frequency investor sentiment also appears to have significant economic value when evaluated with market timing trading strategies.

We would expect profit-maximizing traders to have eliminated persistent price differences between the markets. Institutional impediments and traders' incomplete understanding of the markets, however, could have delayed or prevented price convergence. We find that the two benchmark electricity prices in California -- the Power Exchange's day-ahead price and the Independent System Operator's real-time price -- differed substantially after the markets opened but then appeared to be converging by the beginning of 2000. Starting in May 2000, however, price levels and price differences increased dramatically. We consider several explanations for the significant price differences and conclude that rapidly changing market rules and market fundamentals, including one buyer's attempt to exercise a form of monopsony power, made it difficult for traders to take advantage of opportunities that ex post appear to have been profitable.",

Thus, short-term contrarian strategies, the profitability of which is viewed as the reward to liquidity provision, are more rewarding in corporate bonds.

        "abstract": "The tendency of some investors to hold on to their losing stocks creates a spread between a stock's fundamental value and its equilibrium price, as well as price underreaction to information. Spread convergence, arising from the random evolution of fundamental values and updating of reference prices, generates predictable equilibrium prices that will be interpreted as possessing momentum. Cross-sectional empirical tests are consistent with the model. A variable proxying for aggregate unrealized capital gains appears to be the key variable that generates the profitability of a momentum strategy. Past one-year returns have no predictability for the cross-section of returns once this variable is controlled for.",

We find the relation to be further complicated by the sign and consistency of the past return that also varies, somewhat sensibly, with the season and the tax environment. Accounting for these additional effects using a parsimonious technical trading rule generates surprisingly large abnormal returns, despite controlling for microstructure effects, transaction costs, and date-snooping biases. The documented variation in profits across stock characteristics, season, and tax environment appears inconsistent with existing theory, but may point to future explanations for the relation between past and expected returns.",

Newsletters change their asset mix between equity and cash using relatively simple rules that are strongly influenced by past market returns while macro-economic variables have only a very weak influence on their asset allocation decisions. On aggregate, newsletters do not outperform a passive investment strategy but there exist well-defined newsletter sub-groups (active newsletters, contrarian newsletters) that exhibit market-timing ability. Furthermore, when we examine the recommendations of individual newsletters at a higher frequency (daily as opposed to monthly), we find considerable evidence of timing-ability. There is also evidence of persistence in newsletters' performance and a trading strategy that follows the average recommendations of newsletters that have performed well in the past 10 months is capable of outperforming the market on a risk-adjusted basis (the annual over-performance is 2.56%).",

My analysis also shows that portfolios recommended by both momentum following and contrarian newsletters are capable of outperforming a fully invested benchmark portfolio.

In this paper, we measure inefficiency in five country/region segmented Bitcoin markets based on dynamic estimation of the fractional integration order of their price series. Results reveal a time-varying and country-specific pattern of inefficiency in the five Bitcoin markets, although the degree of inefficiency in each market has declined over time. Further, we introduce a new decomposition method to disentangle components of the inefficiency degree. Results suggest that the total variation around the convergence benchmark has fallen, whilst the proportion due to the difference between convergence and efficiency has risen from approximately 77% in 2013 to almost 100% in 2020. Besides, evidence of convergence emerges until the outbreak of COVID-19, beyond which the inefficiency degree diverges measurably. We show that Bitcoin markets have become more efficient after the first-wave COVID era and then the nature of market segmentation has played a less important role, levelling the cross-market difference and thus reducing the potential for arbitrage.",

The new framework, used in this paper, combining a VECM and a FIGARCH models by a three-step estimation allows us to greatly improve the accuracy of the econometric estimates. Using data from 37 countries all over the world, throughout the period spanning from January 2006 to March 2017, our study provides worldwide evidence rejecting to some extent, conversely to the results of the literature, the randomness of the credit derivative markets. The implication of our results is that speculators can beat the market by predicting CDS performances, especially during crisis periods.",

For instance, it is still discussed that market cannot be outperformed in the long run (Detry and Gregoire, 2001), persistent market anomalies cannot be easily explained in this theoretical framework (Shiller, 2003) and some talented hedge-fund managers keep earning excess risk-adjusted rates of returns regularly. We concentrate in this paper on the weak form of efficiency(Fama, 1970). We focus on the efficacity of simple technical trading rules, following a large research stream presented in Park and Irwin (2004). Nevertheless, we depart from previous works in many ways : we first have a large population of technical investment rules (more than 260.000) exploiting real-world data to manage a financial portfolio. Very few researches have used such a large amount of calculus to examine the EMH. Our experimental design allows for strategy selection based on past absolute performance. We take into account the data-snooping risk, which is an unavoidable problem in such broad-spectrum researches, using a rigorous Bootstrap Reality Check procedure. While market inefficiencies, after including transaction costs, cannot clearly be successfully exploited, our experiments present troubling outcomes inviting close re-consideration of the weak-form EMH.",

It is argued that traders with different time horizons will look at series of price changes recorded at different time intervals. Small price variations will be of higher importance to short term traders than to longer term traders. We generate various time series to reflect these different time horizons. The duration between these price changes is specified by a model inspired by the Autoregressive Conditional Duration (ACD) model of Engle and Russell (1997). We also introduce threshold versions for the duration and return specifications, where the estimates depend on a state-of-the-world defined by thresholds. We find that the expected conditional durations are highly significant in predicting future returns, even when a three months\u00e2\u0080\u0099 out-of-sample period is used.

This view is consistent with the Efficient Market Hypothesis. The other view is the \"behavioral view\", which states that some investors persistently underestimate the true value of high quality firms. We find no evidence in favor of the \"risk view\": The returns from investing in quality firms are abnormally high on a risk-adjusted basis, and are not prone to crashes. We provide novel evidence in favor of the \"behavioral view\": In their forecasts of future prices, and while being overall overoptimistic, analysts systematically underestimate the future return of high quality firms, compared to low quality firms.",

To this end, we first extend the FCVAR model to accommodate deterministic trends in the levels of the processes. The methodological contribution is to provide representation theory for the FCVAR model with deterministic trends, where we show that the presence of the deterministic trend in the process induces both restricted and unrestricted constant terms in the vector error correction model. The consequences for the cointegration rank test are also briefly discussed. In our empirical application we use the data from Figuerola-Ferretti and Gonzalo (2010), who conduct a similar analysis using the usual (non-fractional) cointegrated VAR model. The main conclusion from the empirical analysis is that, when using the FCVAR model, there is more support for the cointegration vector (1,-1)' in the long-run equilibrium relationship between spot and futures prices, and hence less evidence of long-run backwardation, compared to the results from the non-fractional model. Specifically, we reject the hypothesis that the cointegration vector is (1,-1) using standard likelihood ratio tests only for the lead and nickel markets.",

The persistence of low interest rates is spurring research on this question because of the need to increase yields, while limiting the variability of investment results. Payouts of savings account units aim to achieve an almost riskless outcome over a long horizon. We show that they can be managed as contingent claims and, when denominated in units of a stock index, less expensively than under classical risk-neutral assumptions. To assess the robustness of the proposed hedge portfolios, we introduce a simple overfunded scheme and show its reliability using bootstrapping. The results show that by applying an overfunding of 6%, the probability of not achieving the target is less than 1%. At the heart of this result are the mean-reversion and the leverage effect of the minimal market model, together with the supermartingale property of the benchmarked savings account.",

This paper proposes an alternative framework to decompose the dependence using quantile regression. It is demonstrated that the methodology provides a detailed picture of dependence including asymmetric and non-linear relationships. In addition, changes in the degree or structure of dependence can be modelled and tested for each quantile of the distribution. The empirical part applies the framework to three different sets of financial time-series and demonstrates substantial differences in dependence patterns among asset classes and through time. The analysis of 54 global equity markets shows that detailed information about the structure of dependence is crucial to adequately assess the benefits of diversification in normal times and crisis times.",

Exploiting an unanticipated mechanical change in how the benchmark Lehman bond indices are constructed in 2005, we show that rating-induced market segmentation of the bond market into investment-grade and high-yield sectors has a first-order impact on bond prices. Bonds that are mechanically upgraded to investment-grade due to the Lehman announcement have positive abnormal returns of two percent on average and exhibit abnormal order flows over several months. The abnormal bond returns are larger for bonds with longer maturities and higher turnover. We find that institutional investors with rating's-based portfolo constraints substantially increase their holdings in the a ected bonds. In addition, return correlations with the investment-grade index increase for the upgraded bonds. Bonds on watch for downgrade to high-yield but with favorable Fitch rating experience reduced selling and rapid price recovery.",

Traders with less precise signals will choose a naked option strategy, while traders at the low spectrum of the precision scale will invest in the underlying stock. Thus, the low volume of pure volatility trades observed by Lakonishok et al. (2007) does not necessarily imply that only fringe traders have chosen to speculate on volatility.

To this end, we first extend the FCVAR model to accommodate deterministic trends in the levels of the processes. The methodological contribution is to provide a representation theory for the FCVAR model with deterministic trends, where we show that the presence of the deterministic trend in the process induces both restricted and unrestricted constant terms in the vector error correction model. The consequences for the cointegration rank test are also briefly discussed. In our empirical application we use the data from Figuerola-Ferretti and Gonzalo (2010), who conduct a similar analysis using the usual (non-fractional) cointegrated VAR model. The main conclusion from the empirical analysis is that, when using the FCVAR model, there is more support for the cointegration vector (1,\u00e2\u0088\u00921)' in the long-run equilibrium relationship between spot and futures prices, and hence less evidence of long-run backwardation, compared to the results from the non-fractional model.

We show that the effect of a longer investment horizon appears as either an increase or a decrease in the fraction of strategy adopted by long-term traders, depending on the values of the risk-free rate in the economy and the variance perceived by both types of traders. Specifically, when long-term traders are fundamentalists, we consider whether an increase in the intensity of choice to switch predictors can lead to market instability, which is the main result obtained by Brock and Hommes (1998). This is robust if the transaction cost borne by short-term traders is less than the training cost borne by longterm traders. Furthermore, when there is no transaction cost, to establish the stability of the fundamental steady state, the feasible short-term trend followers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 belief form becomes more restrictive if the ratio of variance in the long-term investment horizon to that in the short-term investment horizon is larger than the risk-free rate in the economy.",

In this paper we use a sentiment series, developed by TRNA, to construct a series of daily sentiment scores for Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) stock index component companies. A variety of forms of this measure, namely basic scores, absolute values of the series, squared values of the series, and the rst dierences of the series, are used to estimate three standard volatility models, namely GARCH, EGARCH and GJR. We use these alternative daily DJIA market sentiment scores to examine the relationship between nancial news sentiment scores and the volatility of the DJIA return series.

This behavior was tested under different conditions, among them restrictions on asset holdings or different information conditions. Basic financial theory suggests that subjects buy and sell according to expectations regarding the future prices of assets. On the other hand, behavioral biases, such as the disposition effect, suggest that subjects are affected by past performance of assets. In a series of experiments, subjects were asked to allocate a given endowment among six assets. All the assets had the same normal distribution. The results show that when subjects were not restricted regarding the number of assets they were allowed to hold and were given information only on the asset they hold, the holding time for losing and winning assets was the same, indicating that there was no effect of past performance. On the other hand, when subjects were required to hold three assets at all times and replace one asset on each round, they tended to sell losing assets too soon and hold winning assets too long. The results also show that subjects who are given information on market returns tend to sell winning assets (relatively to the market) too soon and hold losing assets too long.",

It is demonstrated that (i) dispersion of expectations about future short rates is sufficient for individual traders to systematically predict excess returns and (ii) the new term structure dynamics driven by speculative trade is orthogonal to public information in real time, but (iii) can nevertheless be quantified using only publicly available yield data. The model is estimated using monthly data on US short to medium term Treasuries from 1964 to 2007 and it provides a good t of the data.

Using analyst forecast revisions and earnings announcements as proxies of news, we find mixed evidence in support of this hypothesis. We confirm that stocks of firms whose prospects are highly uncertain display a relatively large delayed price reaction (so-called continuation) after the release of news, but we argue that this evidence does not necessarily imply a slower adjustment speed. Indeed, for these stocks the immediate reaction to news is also relatively strong. In fact, the magnitude of the delayed price reaction (the price continuation) depends both on the degree of price sluggishness and on the \u00c3\u00af\u00c2\u00bf\u00c2\u00bdscale\u00c3\u00af\u00c2\u00bf\u00c2\u00bd of the news hitting the stock.

We then compare these measures across portfolios of stocks characterized by different degrees of uncertainty. Our findings indicate that: (i) stock prices characterized by high uncertainty tend to adjust to bad news more sluggishly than those characterized by low uncertainty; (ii) the opposite holds true in the case of good news; (iii) stock prices characterized by high uncertainty tend to adjust to bad news more sluggishly than to good news. Previous empirical literature focuses on price continuation patterns but neglects to control for the \u00c3\u00af\u00c2\u00bf\u00c2\u00bdscale\u00c3\u00af\u00c2\u00bf\u00c2\u00bd of the news, reaching erroneous conclusions.",

The analysis is divided into two phases: first, we estimate the impact of each single political and economic news item on asset price changes and their conditional variance; second, those items that are identified as significant in the first stage are then aggregated into six dummies according to their nature and origin and employed as exogenous variables in a trivariate Garch scheme.

After adjusting for different maturities and coupon rates, we compute a yield spread between on- and off-the-run ten-year BTPs and regress this quantity on seven well-established liquidity metrics, explicitly distinguishing between current and future liquidity. We find that higher liquidity is indeed reflected in higher prices. Based on these results, we obtain a novel estimate of the liquidity premium, according to which the liquidity deterioration that occurred during the sovereign debt crisis lasted longer, but was of a smaller magnitude than that recorded during the Covid-19 pandemic.",

We motivate a correspondence of the statistical factors to traditional dimensions of liquidity as well as the notion of order and trade based liquidity measures. We find evidence of multiple liquidity risk premia, but only a subset of the financial liquidity factors are associated with significant risk premia. These are the factors that we relate to the dimensions of immediacy and resilliency, while the depth dimension does not command a risk premium in any of the models. Our results suggests caution when choosing liquidity variables in asset pricing applications, since liquidity premia may be reflected in only some dimensions of liquidity.",

Interestingly, some measures indicate that the implicit cost of trading has been lower in earlier periods than it is today. Another important finding is that there is a strong counter cyclical relationship between proportional transaction costs measured by the relative spread and the business cycle measured by the output gap. The average relative spread also responds very quickly to the turning points of the business cycle. This result suggest that liquidity measures provide important real time information about the current state of the economy as well as market participants expectations about future economic growth.",

Such a test is consistent against any deviation from non-causality in distribution, as opposed to the existing tests that check only noncausality in certain moment. This test is readily extended to test non-causality in different quantile ranges, and the testing results enable us to identify the quantile range for which causality is relevant. In the empirical studies of 3 major stock market indices, we find that, while the conventional test suggests no causality in mean, there are strong evidences that lagged volume Granger causes return in all but some middle quantiles. In particular, the causal effects have opposite signs at lower and upper quantiles and are stronger at more extreme quantiles. These relations form (symmetric) V shapes across quantiles. They also show that the dispersion of the return distribution increases with volume so that volume has a positive effect on return volatility. It is also shown that the quantile causal effects of lagged return on volume are mainly negative.",

In the standard approach of the model, both the test portfolios and the factor portfolios SMB and HML are formed on the basis of size and B/M. This gives rise to a potential overlapping bias in the time-series regressions. Based on a resampling method and the split sample approach already proposed by Fama and French (1993), we provide an in-depth analysis of the effect of overlapping for a broad sample of European stocks. We find that the overlapping bias is non-negligible, contrary to what seems to be general opinion.

Two kinds of anomalies, namely underreaction and overreaction, have been established by an impressive record of empirical work. While underreaction defines a slow adjustment of prices to corporate events or announcements, overreaction deals with extreme stock price reactions to previous information or past performance. Theoretical models have shown that both phenomena find potential explanations in cognitive biases, that is, investor irrationality. This study investigates current and past earnings surprises and subsequent market reaction for listed US companies over the period 1983-1999. The results suggest that investors simultaneously exhibit short-term underreaction to earnings announcements and long-term overreaction to past highly unexpected earnings. A potential explanation for the reported overreaction phenomenon is the representativeness bias. As I show, the overreaction and the later reversal is stronger for events, which exhibit a long series of similar past earnings surprises.",

        "abstract": "We believe that in order to test for weak form efficiency in the market a vast pool of individual stocks must be analyzed rather than a stock market index. In this paper, we use a model-based bootstrap to generate a series of simulated trials and apply a modified chart pattern recognition algorithm to all stocks listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX). We compare the number of patterns detected in the original price series with the number of patterns found in the simulated series. By simulating the price path we eliminate specific time dependencies present in real data, making price changes purely random. Patterns, if consistently identified, carry information which adds value to the investment process, however, this informativeness does not guarantee profitability. We draw conclusions on the relative efficiency of some sectors of the economy. Although, we fail to reject the null hypothesis of weak form efficiency on the TSX, some sectors of the Canadian economy appear to be less efficient than others. In addition, we find negative dependency of pattern frequencies on the two moments of return distributions, variance and kurtosis.",

To do so, we utilize the recently proposed Efficiency Index to find out that the most efficient among all of the analyzed commodities is heating oil, closely followed by WTI crude oil, cotton, wheat, and coffee. On the other end of the ranking scale we find live cattle and feeder cattle. The efficiency is also found to be characteristic for specific groups of commodities, with energy commodities being the most efficient and other agricultural commodities (composed mainly of livestock) the least efficient groups. We also discuss contributions of long-term memory, fractal dimension and approximate entropy to the total inefficiency. Last but not least, we come across the nonstandard relationship between the fractal dimension and the Hurst exponent. For the analyzed dataset, the relationship between these two variables is positive, meaning that local persistence (trending) is connected to global anti-persistence. We attribute this behavior to specifics of commodity futures: they may be predictable over a short term and locally, but over a long term they return to their fundamental prices.",

        "abstract": "Taking a dynamic view, this paper assesses the extent to which profitability shocks affect the size premium in the Chinese market. In the short run, there is a significant U-shaped relationship between size and profitability shocks; i.e., both small and large firms experience large and (in most cases) positive profitability shocks, while firms with medium market capitalizations display small profitability shocks. In the long run, profitability shocks in large firms remain large and stable, while profitability shocks in small firms decrease sharply. Adjusting for profitability shocks increases the returns of small firms but decreases the returns of large firms, indicating that large and positive profitability shocks in small firms cannot bring investors sizable returns even though the correlation between profitability shocks and returns is positive. Mismatches between profitability shocks and the per-unit return impact of such shocks (e.g., when firms experience positive shocks but the market reacts to these shocks irrationally) can help explain this phenomenon. Our work reveals that in terms of fundamentals, large firms are very worthy of investment owing to their superb fundamental performance, i.e., large and persistent profitability shocks.",

We also find slightly higher stock return volatility and a small reduction in liquidity when naked short sales are allowed.

However, the dilemma of market efficiency still remains intractable. It is more likely that any literature review in respect of market efficiency would produce contradictory results: for a single paper producing empirical evidence supporting the market efficiency, we can perhaps find a contradictory paper which empirically establishes market inefficiency. Paradoxically, popular models in finance developed in 1970s or 1980s were based on the assumption that the market under consideration was efficient. The conventional bond or stock or option pricing models are common examples of this type. In an alternative approach, we have worked out a model which incorporates market sentiments in the domain of the standard rational model of asset pricing. Our model would be well applicable for a \u00e2\u0080\u0098less than\u00e2\u0080\u0099 efficient market and, therefore may be the useful input in investors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 policies.",

The paper then focuses on the theoretical foundation of the EMH, and show that market efficiency could co-exit with heterogeneous beliefs and individual irrationality so long as individual errors are cross sectionally weakly dependent in the sense defined by Chudik, Pesaran, and Tosetti (2010). But at times of market euphoria or gloom these individual errors are likely to become cross sectionally strongly dependent and the collective outcome could display significant departures from market efficiency.

In this set-up, the public signal induces informed investors to participate in the market as it reduces uncertainty. While it increases adverse selection costs, the increase in participation results in more informative prices. Apart from the static effects, the model's dynamics deliver testable hypotheses about price and liquidity before and after the signal's release. Using transaction-level data, I estimate the effect of the release of the Weekly Petroleum Status Report on the bid-ask spread, volume, and midpoint returns via a difference-in-difference strategy. I find that the mean bid-ask spread doubles immediately after the release and that volume increases by 32 percent. Moreover, this effect persists over time, and is independent of the report's content whereas prices react to this information immediately. Nevertheless, liquidity at the end of the trading session is not affected by the report.",

I then develop a pricing technique using nonparametrically estimated marginal risk-neutral densities (based on options data) and a nonparametric dependence function (based on historical return data). By using nonparametric estimation, I avoid the pricing biases that result from incorrect parametric assumptions such as lognormality. ; I apply this technique to estimate the joint risk-neutral density of euro-dollar and yen-dollar returns. I compare the nonparametric risk-neutral density with density based on a lognormal dependence function and nonparametric marginals. The nonparametric euro-yen risk-neutral density has greater volatility, skewness, and kurtosis than the density based on a lognormal dependence function. In a comparison of pricing accuracy for euro-yen futures options, I find that the nonparametric model is superior to the lognormal model.",

Using encompassing tests, the models based on consensus forecast data can for six firms unilaterally encompass the models based on accounting data. The reverse result holds for five firms.

        "abstract": "The purpose of this paper is to provide an explanation for relative pricing of futures contracts with respect to underlying stocks based on short sales constraints and informational lags between the two markets. In this model stocks and futures are perfect substitutes, except that short sales are only allowed in futures markets. The futures price is more informative than the stock price, because the existence of short sales constraints in the stock market prohibits trading in some states of the world. If an informed trader with no initial endowment in stocks gets a negative signal about the common future value of stocks and futures, she is only able to sell futures. In addition uninformed traders also face similar short sales constraint in the stock market. As a result of the short sales constraint, the stock price is less informative than the futures price even if the informed trader has received positive information. Stocks can be under- and overpriced compared to futures, provided that market makers in stocks and futures only observe with a lag the order flow in the other market. Our theory implies that 1.) the basis is positively associated with the contemporaneous futures returns, 2.) the basis is negatively associated with the contemporaneous stock return, 3.) futures returns lead stock returns, 4.) stock returns also lead futures returns, but to a lesser extent and 5.) the trading volume in the stock market is positively associated with the contemporaneous stock return. The model is tested using daily data from the Finnish index futures markets. Finland provides a good environment for testing our theory, since short sales were not allowed during the time that we have data (May 27, 1988 - May 31, 1994). We find strong empirical support for our implications.",

The framework features non-trivial portfolio choices among risk-free bonds and risky assets offered in the domestic and foreign economies, where the exchange rate between the two economies is managed through a two-sided target zone regime. Our simulation results show that the equity-return differential between the two economies serves as a counter-balance factor of the risk-free interest-rate differential in determining the movements of the exchange rate.",

According to the direction-learning hypothesis, (directional) informed investors' net buying pressure of calls (puts) raises the implied volatilities of calls (puts) and lowers the implied volatilities of puts (calls). In addition, their net buying pressure can also predict future index returns. According to the volatility-learning hypothesis, (volatility) informed investors' net buying pressure is always positively related to implied volatilities.

This long span of high-frequency data allows us to gain new insights about the joint behavior of these series. We first confirm the presence of a substantial association between interdealer order flow and exchange rate returns at frequencies ranging from one minute to one week, but, using our long span of data, we find that the association is weaker at lower frequencies, with far less long-term association between cumulative order flow and long-term exchange rate movements. We study the linearity and time-variation of the association between high-frequency exchange rate returns and order flow, and document an intradaily pattern to the relationship: it is weakest at times when markets are most active. Overall, our study tends to support the view that, while order flow plays a crucial role in high-frequency exchange rate movements, its role in driving long-term fluctuations is much more limited.",

In particular, since at-the-money implied volatilities are usually inserted in the smile function by computing some average of both call and put implied ones, we investigate the performance of a weighted average of at-the-money call and put implied volatilities with weights proportional to trading volume. Two hypotheses are tested: unbiasedness and efficiency of the different volatility forecasts. The investigation is pursued in the Dax index options market, by using synchronous prices matched in a one-minute interval. It was found that the information content of implied volatility has a humped shape, with out-of-the-money options being less informative than at-the-money ones.

We combine upside and downside implied volatilities in a single asymmetry index called the risk-asymmetry index (RAX). The risk-asymmetry index (RAX) plays a crucial role in predicting future returns, since it subsumes all the information embedded in both the Italian skewness index ITSKEW and the Italian volatility index (ITVIX).

Second, we examine the nature of the variance risk premium and shed light on the information content of different parts of the risk neutral distribution of the stock price, by using a model-independent approach based on corridor measures.

Our results, which point to a better performance of corridor implied volatilities with respect to both Black-Scholes implied volatility and model-free implied volatility, are in favour of narrow corridors. The volatility index proposed is obtained with an overall 50% cut of the risk neutral distribution. The properties of the volatility index are explored by analysing both the contemporaneous relationship between implied volatility changes and market returns and the usefulness of the proposed index in forecasting future market returns.",

        "abstract": "The aim of this paper is to investigate the relation between implied volatility, historical volatility and realised volatility in the Dax index options market. Since implied volatility varies across option type (call versus put) we run a horse race of different implied volatility estimates: implied call, implied put and average implied that is a weighted average of call and put implied volatility with weights proportional to traded volume. Two hypotheses are tested in the Dax index options market: unbiasedness and efficiency of the different volatility forecasts. Our results suggest that all the three implied volatility forecasts are unbiased (after a constant adjustment) and efficient forecasts of future realised volatility in that they subsume all the information contained in historical volatility.",

We use the perspective of attention grabbing as a particular form of price pressure to analyze the market reaction to the dissemination of analysts\u00e2\u0080\u0099 recommendations through the press. This perspective allows the prediction of an asymmetric market reaction to \u00e2\u0080\u009cbuy\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009csell\u00e2\u0080\u009d advice, which has previously been detected in a few other empirical studies but is otherwise difficult to rationalize within the standard price pressure hypothesis. In particular, we analyze the content of a weekly column in the most important Italian financial newspaper that presents past information and analysts\u00e2\u0080\u0099 recommendations on listed companies. In doing so, we find an asymmetric price and volume reaction. Contrary to previous evidence, we document a positive relation between the number of analysts quoted in the column and the price (volume) increase associated with positive recommendations. Because the weekly columns simply attract the attention of investors with no additional new information, it is natural to observe a greater reaction for the most \u00e2\u0080\u009cglamorous\u00e2\u0080\u009d stocks (i.e., the stocks most commonly followed by analysts).",

Our data comes from the Reuters Spot Matching service, the main interbank trading platform in both currency pairs, and covers almost five and a half years of transactions from January 2001 to March 2006, a much longer and more representative time series than many empirical microstructure applications to date. We find that there is a strong contemporaneous relationship between net order flow (the net of buyerinitiated and seller-initiated transactions) and changes in the NZD/USD and AUD/USD at frequencies from one minute to one week, similar to studies on other currencies. We also find that cross-currency order flow has a positive association with changes in the other exchange rate (ie AUD/USD order flow has a positive contemporaneous relationship with changes in the NZD/USD). Finally, we examine a wide range of New Zealand, Australian and US data releases and central bank interest rate decisions and find that order flow plays an important role in communicating different interpretations of macroeconomic news.",

Investors are assumed to be boundedly rational, using a limited set of information including past price history and expectation on future dividends. Investment strategies are dynamically changed based on realized returns within a game theoretical scheme with Nash equilibria. In such a setting, markets behave as complex systems whose payoff reflect an intrinsic financial symmetry that guarantees equilibrium in price dynamics (fundamentalist state) until the symmetry is broken leading to bubble or anti-bubble scenarios (speculative state). We model such two-phase transition in a micro-to-macro scheme through a Ginzburg-Landau-based power expansion leading to a market temperature parameter which modulates the state transitions in the market. Via simulation we prove that complex market dynamics can be phenomenologically explained by the number of traders, the strategies used by agents and the past price history, all included in our market temperature parameter",

We show that the reaction to these news variables can be quite different under different assumptions about their precisions in different states.

We employ the chi-plot proposed by Fisher and Switzer (2001) and the Kendall plot proposed by Genest and Boies (2003) to examine the dependence in these six markets for the pre- and post-1997 financial crisis periods. We find that marginal distributions of all seven markets have notably changed due to this financial crisis, and that the functional forms of the underlying joint distributions generating the dependence in the Korean, Indonesian and Taiwan markets have also changed for the post-crisis period. It appears that the same parametric copula can capture the dependence in the Singapore, Malaysia and Hong Kong markets for both pre- and post-crisis periods, and that only the tail indices of bivariate distributions between the Thai and these three markets have changed.

End-of-the-year economic growth rates contain considerably more information about expected returns than standard variables used to predict returns, are robust to the choice of macro variables, and work in-sample, out-of-sample, and in subsamples. To explain these results, we show as the second main fi?nding of our paper that economic growth and growth in economic confidence (consumer con?dence and business con?dence) are strongly correlated during the fourth quarter, but not during the other quarters. In summary, we therefore show that when economic growth is low at the end of the year, confi?dence in the economy is also low such that investors require higher future returns. During the rest of the year, there are no such relations between growth, confi?dence, and returns.",

        "abstract": "An important claim of Bayesian learning and a standard assumption in price discovery models is that the strength of the price impact of unanticipated information depends on the precision of the news. In this paper, we test for this assumption by analyzing intra-day price responses of CBOT T-bond futures to U.S. employment announcements. By employing additional detail information besides the widely used headline figures, we extract release-specific precision measures which allow to test for the claim of Bayesian updating. We find that the price impact of more precise information is significantly stronger. The results remain stable even after controlling for an asymmetric price response to 'good' and 'bad' news.",

The results from the ARDL model suggest that herding exists at the JSE. The study also noted that herd behaviour takes place with lapses in time; however the unrestricted error correction results suggest that such behaviour has a high speed of adjustment, implying that herding is a short-lived phenomenon. Since the direction of the market affects investors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 behaviour, the study also investigated the asymmetric effects of herding behaviour during rising versus falling markets. While herding behaviour was identified during a rising market, the results did not support the presence of herd behaviour in a falling market.",

Recently, its futures basis has shown volatile behavior. This could reflect its inefficiency as a hedging tool and the inefficiency in AFET itself. This research examines the predictive power of some economic factors. The monthly data during June 2004 to October 2008 were used in the multiple regression analysis. The findings give evidence of statistically significant explanatory powers of the market and macroeconomic information in estimating the futures basis. The AFET could thus be categorized as semi-strong efficiency form of price. The efficiency could be increased by the effective dissemination of knowledge and information to investors to support their investment decision. In addition, the agricultural price risk should be managed through market-based tools.",

Based on the out-of-sample predicted mean square error, the F-test for two variances (those of both the observed series and the predicted one) and the bootstrap confidence interval and volatility, this method predicts the future behaviour of stock prices more accurately than the traditional random walk model has done.",

Winner portfolios are shown to outperform loser portfolios, sug-gesting that a momentum effect exists in the equity market. Islamic stocks exhibit stronger momentum than conventional stocks. Inter-estingly, although pursuing profit is not the primary goal of Islamic stock investors, the findings indicate that momentum profits for all Islamic stock trading strategies are higher than those for conventional stocks. The prof-its from momentum strategies for both stocks are market-state dependent. In all trading strategies, while there are significant positive momentum profits following market upturns, there is no evidence of profits subsequent to market downturns. Overall, Islamic stocks yield higher momentum profits than conven-tional stocks across market states. These find-ings are robust to using various measures of the state of the market. While the presence of momentum profits is also robust to the inclu-sion of Fama-French\u00e2\u0080\u0099s (1993) risk factors, the risk factors are unable to explain momentum profits, suggesting that the risk-adjusted mo-mentum profits are not due to risk compen-sation.

Using expectations of the S ? P industrial stock price index in the NYSE revealed by J.

Although these premia exhibit very important and time-varying spreads, it is shown that the term premia with shorter horizon tend to converge progressively towards premia with longer horizons. These results show that there are common factors for all premia (past volatility and observed or expected economic variables) and that there is some coherence between the dynamics of premia.

Moreover, findings also suggest that stocks which are upgraded to Group A are exposed to more attention which is in line with the attention hypothesis. The reverse is valid for the downgraded firms.

Furthermore, ourregression-based technique also remedies several well-known weaknesses of the traditional calendartime portfolio approach. By considering a new, unique dataset on more than 40,000 Europeanprivate investors, we illustrate empirically that erroneously ignoring cross-sectional dependenceinherent in microeconometric panel data can lead to severely biased statistical results.

The main purpose here is to address the first cited problem by suggesting a validation methodology that also \"homogenizes\" the securities according to the finite dimensional probability distribution of their return series. The general steps go through the identification of the stochastic processes for the securities returns, the clustering of similar securities and, finally, the identification of presence, or absence, of informatinal content obtained from those price patterns. We illustrate the proposed methodology with a real data exercise including several securities of the global market. Our investigation shows that there is a statistically significant informational content in two out of three common patterns usually found through technical analysis, namely: triangle, rectangle and head and shoulders.",

Using the uncertainty surrounding the agreement's ratification, I show that the pattern of abnormal returns of Canadian manufacturing \u00e2\u0080\u00a6firms was broadly consistent with the predictions of a class of models based on Melitz (2003). Increases in the likelihood of ratification led to stock market gains of exporting firms relative to non-exporters. Moreover, gains were higher in sectors with larger cuts in U.S. import tariffs. Decreases in the likelihood of ratification led to opposite stock market reactions. Results for the impact of Canadian tariff reductions are less conclusive but most specifications suggest that exporters also gained relative to non-exporters in response to such reductions. Translating stock market gains into implied profit changes, I find that CUSFTA increased expected per-period profits of exporters by around 6-7% relative to non-exporters.",

Although previous studies found that value stocks beat growth stocks in bearish and bullish markets, during the GFC, value stocks underperformed growth stocks. Objectives: This paper aims to examine the performance of value and growth stock portfolios after the GFC. Subjects of our analysis are constituent companies of the DJIA index, out of which portfolios of large-cap value and growth stocks have been constructed and evaluated. Methods/Approach: We measure the performance of stock portfolios, which are created based on the na\u00c3\u00afve diversification rule and random weighting approach. Statistical testing includes Levene\u00e2\u0080\u0099s homogeneity test, the Mann-Whitney U test, T-test, and the One-Sample T-test. Results: Growth stock portfolios outperform value stock portfolios after the GFC. The dominance of growth stock portfolios compared to value stock portfolios is significant, and the value premium disappears. Conclusions: Financial theory and investment management implications show that growth stocks have overtaken the dominance over value stocks since 2009. Causes might be in (1) expansionary monetary policy characterized by very low long-term interest rates and (2) high performance of the tech industry to which most growth stocks belong.",

        "abstract": "Following the implementation of capital market reforms, Saudi Arabia has opened up its stock market to international investors. This liberalisation has led to the inclusion of the stock exchange into leading global indices, which is expected to lead to an influx of foreign investment. Thus, it is important and timely to examine the efficiency of the Saudi stock market. To that end, this paper conducts a comprehensive investigation of the predictive ability and profitability of a popular trading rule, the moving average rule, using firm-level data for the Saudi stock market over the period 1st January 2008 to 31st December 2017. The results show that the moving average rule has predictive ability; the active rules for a majority of the sample companies outperformed the corresponding passive strategy. Furthermore, the results were economically significant as the rules were profitable even after the consideration of transaction costs. The results also showed that the most profitable moving average rules were those with short-moving average lengths, and that the introduction of a bandwidth, which serves to eliminate weak trading signals, had a positive impact on rule profitability. Importantly, the analysis showed that the most profitable component of the rule related to short selling as these trades resulted in higher profits than the long positions. A disaggregated analysis of sectors showed that the trading rules outperformed the buy-and-hold strategy in all seven industries considered, while the analysis of covariance revealed the importance of careful selection of filter size. Overall, the analysis documents significant inefficiencies in the Saudi stock market and suggests that the employment of a simple trading rule, based on past price data, can yield substantial profits across companies and sectors even in a costly trading environment. These findings suggest that the recent reforms that were implemented to improve the efficiency of the Saudi stock market have been suboptimal, and that further regulatory reform is required.",

The stock market responds not only to change of the overnight call target rate but also to pronouncements indicating the future monetary policy stance. The impact is largest just before and just after policy signals, which suggests that the stock market moves efficiently to incorporate its expectations of monetary policy in pricing and transaction behavior. Stock market volatility increases around the time of monetary policy announcements, yet regular announcements act as a factor making for reduced volatility. This result implies that stock market volatility can be reduced by making regular announcements. Foreign investors show different patterns in their trading response to monetary policy announcements to those of individual and domestic institutional investors. Finally, in relation to the impact of the characteristics of individual issues on the stock market, the riskier and the smaller a company is, the greater the degree of volatility of its stock price.",

Using the uncertainty surrounding the negotiation and ratification process of the Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement of 1989 (CUSFTA), I estimate the impact of different types of tariff reductions on the abnormal returns of Canadian manufacturing firms. I find that Canadian import tariff reductions lead to lower, and reductions in Canadian intermediate input tariffs to higher abnormal returns. The impact of U.S. tariff reductions is less clear and depends on the size of the affected firms. I also calculate the total profit increase implied by my estimates. Overall, CUSFTA increased per-period profits by around 1.2%. This was mainly driven by intermediate input tariff reductions which more than offset the negative effect of Canadian import tariff reductions.",

Coverage in news analytics speeds up the market reaction in terms of stock price response and trading volume, and increases illiquidity immediately after the article. Furthermore, we document that traders learn dynamically about the precision of news analytics.",

        "abstract": "We investigate whether short sellers are subject to the disposition effect using a novel dataset that allows to identify the weekly closing of short positions. Consistent with the disposition effect, the closing of short sale positions is strongly related to a proxy of Shortsale Capital Gains Overhang (SCGO). Furthermore, while short sellers in general exhibit skill in closing their positions ? i.e. closing is followed by positive stock returns ? the closing explained by SCGO is followed by negative returns. This suggests that the trades are irrational and caused by the disposition effect. Next, we study the implications of short sellers? disposition effect on stock prices. We provide evidence that SCGO is negatively related to future stock returns. This effect exists after controlling for the standard effect of capital gains overhang of other market participants. A trading strategy based on SCGO achieves yearly three-factor alphas of up to 26%. Overall, our results suggest that short sellers, instead of arbitraging away the mispricing caused by the disposition effect of the other market participants, add to this mispricing due to their own behavioral biases.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents novel empirical evidence on key predictions of heterogeneous firm models by examining stock market reactions to the Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement of 1989 (CUSFTA). Using the uncertainty surrounding the agreement's ratification, I show that the pattern of abnormal returns of Canadian manufacturing firms was broadly consistent with the predictions of a class of models based on Melitz (2003). Increases in the likelihood of ratification led to stock market gains of exporting firms relative to non-exporters. Moreover, gains were higher in sectors with larger cuts in U.S. import tariffs. Decreases in the likelihood of ratification led to opposite stock market reactions. Results for the impact of Canadian tariff reductions are less conclusive but most specifications suggest that exporters also gained relative to non-exporters in response to such reductions. Translating stock market gains into implied profit changes, I find that CUSFTA increased expected per-period profits of exporters by around 6-7% relative to non-exporters.",

Empirical evidence also shows that reaching the price limit generates an attention-grabbing effect. Further, in general, small cap firms generate more intensive individual investor herding.

First, promoting short-term momentum, our evidence implies a PTH-anchoring underreaction to recent news, consistent with the short-term contrarian price-dampening channel of Atmaz et al.

Second, promoting short-term reversals, our evidence reinforces the importance of the well-known liquidity-provision-compensation channel. Reversals are especially strong for low-PTH, low-turnover stocks, where the lower PTH implies a generally smaller-cap, less-liquid stock and the lower turnover implies a weaker contrarian-induced underreaction.

Accordingly, we develop a strategy based on time-dependent maximum daily return (denoted as TMAX) by buying (short selling) stocks with the most recent maximum daily returns (MAX) ranked in the bottom (top) decile of the historical distribution. The TMAX strategy generates significant premium that subsumes the profitability of Bali, Cakici, and Whitelaw\u00e2\u0080\u0099s (2011) MAX strategy, but not vice versa. A major advantage of the TMAX strategy is its time-invariant profitability across different periods and sentiment states. Further analyses show that the TMAX premium can be explained by shorting flow and behavioral theories, supporting the time-dependent feature of lottery preference.",

However, most academic studies emphasize that a successful market timing strategy requires a prediction accuracy that is usually not observable in reality.

Our analyses are based on a \u00e2\u0080\u009csimulated market timer\u00e2\u0080\u009d that does not require a specific forecast model.

The trading system is applied to twenty-two years of historical data from 1992 to 2013 for various specifications, taking transaction costs into account. The significance of the results is evaluated with a bootstrap test in which randomly generated orders are compared to orders placed by the trading system. Whereas we find most combinations involving the front-month and second-month futures to be significantly profitable for all commodities tested, the best results for the risk-adjusted Sharpe Ratio are obtained for WTI Crude Oil and Natural Gas, with Sharpe Ratios in excess of 2 for most combinations and a rather smooth performance for all calendar spreads.

        "abstract": "Recent empirical research has documented that the state of the limit order book influences stock investors' strategies. Investors place more aggressive orders when the same side of the order book is thicker, and less aggressive orders when it is thinner. We conjecture and demonstrate that this behavior is related to long memories of trading volume, volatility, and order signs in stock markets. We investigate our conjecture in two types of artificial stock markets: a transparent market, in which agents observe all limit orders on both sides of the book and order volumes at those prices before they trade; and a less transparent market, in which agents observe only the best five bid and ask quotes with the depth available at these limit prices. The first market structure resembles certain actual stock exchanges in the level of pre-trade transparency, such as the Australian Stock Exchange, NYSE OpenBook, and the London Stock Exchange, whereas the second market structure is consistent with stock exchanges such as Euronext Paris, the Toronto Stock Exchange, the Tokyo Stock Exchange, and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing. We demonstrate that our long memory results are robust with different levels of pre-trade transparency, implying that the strategy constructed by the state of the order book is key for explaining long memories in many actual stock exchanges.",

The agent's objective is to optimize the terminal value of herportfolio under a logarithmic utility function. Using techniques of initial enlargement of filtration, we identify the optimal strategy and compute the value of the information. The interest rate is first assumed to be an affine diffusion, then more explicit formulas are computed for the Vasicek interest rate model where the interest rate moves according to an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. We show that when the interest rate process is correlated with the price process of the risky asset, the value of the information is infinite, as is usually the case for initial-enlargement-type problems. However, since the agent does not know exactly the correlation factor, this may induce an infinite loss instead of an infinite gain. Finally weakening the information own by the agent, and assuming that she only knows a lower-bound for the terminal value of the interest rate process, we show that the value of the information is finite.",

Specifically, we estimate quantile autoregressive models for daily exchange rate returns of the USD/EUR, USD/JPY, USD/GBP, USD/AUD, USD/CHF and USD/CAD exchange rates between 1999 and 2014. Testing for the equality of cross-quantile-effects, we reveal substantial state-dependence in the return dynamics. In particular, we find that large US dollar appreciations tend to exhibit positive dependence on past returns, whereas large US dollar depreciations tend to exhibit negative dependence on past returns. Around central return quantiles, however, there is virtually no evidence for significant temporal dependence. Exceptions from this pattern are only apparent for the USD/JPY and the USD/CHF exchange rate. Theoretically, our results point to the presence of over- and undershooting in terms of asymmetric exchange rate adjustment to previous day information.",

        "abstract": "Using high frequency data for the price dynamics of equities we measure the impact that market microstructure noise has on estimates of the: (i) volatility of returns; and (ii) variance-covariance matrix of n assets. We propose a Kalman-filter-based methodology that allows us to deconstruct price series into the true efficient price and the microstructure noise. This approach allows us to employ volatility estimators that achieve very low Root Mean Squared Errors (RMSEs) compared to other estimators that have been proposed to deal with market microstructure noise at high frequencies. Furthermore, this price series decomposition allows us to estimate the variance covariance matrix of $n$ assets in a more efficient way than the methods so far proposed in the literature. We illustrate our results by calculating how microstructure noise affects portfolio decisions and calculations of the equity beta in a CAPM setting.",

Using the SSE 180 Index ETF from May 18, 2006 to December 8, 2020, we document that investors who apply technical rules on China's equity ETFs incline to do so because of the stylized fact that the skewness feature of technical analysis can meet their desire for it. We also find that investors should design a technical rule with a more reasonable and practical lag length of the price range (or the price change percentage) to fulfill their desire for higher skewness value. Moreover, we confirm that our empirical findings are robust even with the consideration of potential factors such as position constraint, market timing, reference return, market condition, transaction costs, and data-snooping bias.",

The results show that the factor model not only fits the gambling characteristics of the Chinese stock market well but also has strong explanatory power for common market anomalies. Through the index of capital gains over-hang (Wang et al., 2016), this paper further finds that facing different degrees of losses, investors will show different gambling preferences. The factor model also shows stronger explanatory power in the sample with more losses, revealing the investment characteristics of retail investors that the more you gamble and the more you lose.

We examine the asymmetric impacts of monetary shocks on stock returns across high oil price events and non-high oil price events over the period from 1995 to 2008. We ask how these impacts respond to the relative ability of firms to obtain external finance. Our findings suggest that more energy-intensive industries and durable-goods industries react more significantly to monetary shocks based on high oil price events than on those based on non-high oil price events. By controlling for the capacity for external finance, the intraday windows reveal that a monetary surprise for the high oil price events has a bigger impact on stock returns than for the non-high oil price events. Firms with financing constraints find that the adverse impact of a surprise monetary policy action on high oil price events is amplified in the medium profitability category, while the impact of a surprise monetary policy action on non-high oil price events is amplified in the lowest profitability category.",

This statistically significant, but economically modest, decline may suggest that the fraction of informed short sellers actually increases if (as Diamond and Verrecchia (1987) suggest) the uncertainty around earnings announcements increases short selling costs and causes uninformed short sellers to withdraw from the market. While we find a statistically and economically significant inverse relation between pre-announcement short activity and announcement period returns, when we control for the non-announcement ability of short sellers to predict future returns documented by Diether et al.

First, we find that both regular news and extreme shocks significantly impact the distribution of tail risk during daytime trading and overnight non-trading sessions, with the latter showing stronger effects. Second, extreme shocks have a greater impact on intraday return predictability, with most market shocks obliterating the predictive power of first half-hour returns. Third, the predictability of the first half-hour returns comes primarily from the market opening session from 9:30 am to 10:00 am, and overnight returns lose their predictability.

Our findings suggest higher overall interconnectedness between the carbon price returns and sustainability indices, with a total spillover index of 69.75%. More specifically, the magnitude of spillovers is substantially higher in the short term than in the long terms. Moreover, European, France, and Germany sustainability indices exhibit the properties of the largest transmitter of spillover of returns towards the system whereas carbon prices are the lowest contributor to transmitting the spillovers towards the system. In the connectedness network, ETS offers a good investment opportunity with Belgium and Finland sustainability indices due to the lower level of returns connectedness.

The late boost in computer power and data engineering brought about a myriad of algorithms that are wrapped under the larger title of Data Science. The apparent proliferation of these algorithms is due to their employment for several applications that range from simple classification problems, such as spam e-mail identification, to pattern detection in images and videos and several forecasting applications. Heralding the world of machine learning, these algorithms are trained on large amounts of data with the objective to extract repetitive structures that are likely to persist. It is therefore explainable the recent attention that these algorithms are given from the perspective of economic applications. This paper employs a recurrent neural network algorithm on daily data for several stock market indices in order to detect anomalous behaviour. The approach is rooted in the jump-detection literature that has the objective to identify outlying realizations of log-returns for diverse stock market data. We show that this approach establishes economically significant patterns that can be considered as anomalies when compared to their past dynamics.",

We found strong evidence of the disposition effect, studied on the basis of trades, volume and value traded. This preference for realizing gains to losses was observed every month of the year and globally for all individual investors. Even at the end of the fiscal year, the disposition effect still holds, as opposed to the evidence found in other markets. We also studied the disposition effect related to market tendency. By dividing the data period into a bull and a bear period, we found evidence of disposition effect for both periods, but with differences in terms of its intensity. In the bull market period, the disposition effect is even more evident than in the bear market. We believe these results can be explained with behavioral reasons. We also investigated the disposition effect related to proxies of investors' sophistication. We divided investors on the basis of the trading frequency, volume of transactions and portfolio value and found evidence that investors in the higher percentiles are less prone to the disposition effect than the ones in the lower percentiles, even though both exhibit evidence of this effect.",

However, for the sample of 65 European large-cap mutual equity funds, performance is shown to be very sensitive to the empirical estimation approach applied. Furthermore, the performance alphas are not robust over the conditional residual return distribution. This indicates that the performance is asymmetric with respect to the conditional outcome. A large part of the individual funds significantly underperform the benchmark in the lower tail of the conditional distribution. From a risk-averse investor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s point of view, the results regarding the performance of an equally weighted fund of funds, is more comforting.

To mitigate the estimation bias, we employ a conditional factor model, as in Avramov and Chordia (2006), to estimate systematic risk exposure and IVOL. Our empirical results show that the conditional IVOL estimates do not imply a negative return premium when firm fundamentals are used as conditioning variables, and the associated conditional factor-adjusted alpha is much smaller than the original IVOL puzzle.

The bulk of the discussion tends to focus on whether trading activity in the stock market is informative about stock volatility. To analyze the information in option trading activity for stock market volatility, a sample of 15 stocks with the highest option trading volume is selected. For each stock, it is noted that the trading activities in the put and call option markets have significant explanatory power for stock market volatility. In addition, the results indicate that the call option trading activity has a stronger impact on stock volatility compared with that of the put options. Our results demonstrate that information and sentiment in the option market is useful for the estimation of stock market volatility. Also, the significance of the effects of option trading activity on stock price volatility is observed to be comparable to that of stock market trading activity. Furthermore, the persistence and asymmetric effects in the volatility of some stocks tend to disappear once option trading activity is taken into account.",

        "abstract": "This study aims to examine return predictability in 24 emerging markets disaggregated in different regions. We propose four specifications, including a benchmark model. Then, an augmented model appropriate for each country, including a large set of potential factors, is evaluated. Furthermore, a dynamic multifactor model is investigated for all countries. Finally, we relax the symmetric hypothesis in asset return predictability based on a non-parametric non-linear approach: the projection pursuit regression model. Our study reveals three main findings. First, we reject all previous findings supporting a standard model of asset return predictability that is valuable for all countries, as we show that each country has specific domestic factors (both macroeconomic and financial) useful to predict future returns. Second, our empirical framework shows that asset return predictability might be robustly modelled based on non-linear specification based on the projection pursuit regression model. Our findings\u00e2\u0080\u0099 explanatory power of out-of-sample estimations is economically relevant. Our results are useful for investors and policy-makers for portfolio diversification and regulation policies.",

This effect is measured by employing the extreme dependence measure and connectedness approach across different quantile distributions. Our data ranges from January 1, 2006, to July 5, 2021. Oil shocks are extracted using the work of Ready (2018) as supply, demand and risk-related shocks. Our results highlight that demand shocks exhibit strong coherence as compared with supply and risk-driven shocks in the short-run. However, during extreme market conditions, we witness the pronounced effect of oil shocks on stock returns. Results of connectedness using Ando et al. (2022) show that France significantly transmits to the system across all quantile distributions. Among BRICs, Brazil appears as the most substantial net contributor. In terms of net receiver, Japanese equity market appears most sensitive to oil shocks followed by the Indian and Chinese stock markets.

        "abstract": "This study aims to investigate the dynamic relationship between oil prices and stock markets in the G5+ countries using Parkinson's proximal realized volatility. We separate positive and negative semi-variance to compute asymmetric aggregate static spillovers according to the Diebold and Yilmaz (DY) approach. Moreover, we use a Quantile VAR to investigate the behavior of series in different quantiles corresponding to different market scenarios. Consistently with the literature concerns, we use a daily sample of market indices prices with the Brent oil price from June 1, 2017, to July 2, 2022. We found an asymmetric linkage between oil prices and the stock market, which has significant implications for portfolio hedging strategies. Specifically, our research indicates that the impact of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict on the energy crisis has been significantly higher than that of the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in the short term. However, we observe a higher persistence of negative spillovers for COVID-19 compared to those recorded during the Russia-Ukraine war. From a methodological viewpoint, this result enforces the choice of an asymmetric model to investigate the volatility transmission between financial market series. Finally, we found crude oil to emit volatility spillovers in quantiles above 80%. This result emphasizes the instability perceived in crude oil price when general market volatility increase. Quite the opposite, about one-third of oil price shocks, are linked to the national stock exchange uncertainty in low and middle quantiles, underlining the investors' dependency on this commodity. These results have important implications for policymakers and institutional authorities, who must consider the changing macroeconomic environment and reduce dependence on Russian energy.",

We examined the effects of the incidents on prices by employing event study analysis and using both daily and intraday data. The results of the intra-daily analysis demonstrated that the attacks that occurred during trading hours had the greatest negative effects in the first 30 min. Thereafter, the market ensured recovery by compensating its loss until the end of the day. When the daily effects of the attacks were observed, it was found that only four of the thirty-five attacks caused significant negative impacts on the days they occurred. Moreover, in the aftermath, the 6- and 11-day cumulative abnormal returns were significantly negative in only one among these four attacks. Therefore, the case-by-case findings showed that the Borsa Istanbul equity market is resistant to major terrorist attacks. Although the investors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 intense negative reactions were identified immediately after the incidents, it was clarified that they restored their confidence quickly, and the market turmoil mostly disappeared on the day of the incident.",

After a prolonged bear market hits bottom, the loser portfolio is mostly composed of highly volatile and leveraged small-cap stocks, which have lost nearly 83% of their market value over the preceding year and are thus susceptible to heavy rebounds. Interestingly, the momentum crash phenomenon seems to disappear once we control for exposures to the Fama\u00e2\u0080\u0093French factors, with the market factor being the most relevant.

We use quantile autoregression to investigate the presence of (non-)linear temporal dependence in foreign exchange returns at various intra-daily time-horizons, ranging from ten minutes up to three hours. Specifically, we investigate an 11-year long sample of non-intermittent high frequency returns for the Euro (EUR), the British Pound (GBP) and the Japanese Yen (JPY) against the US-Dollar (USD). In contrast to previous studies, we find the temporal dependence of intra-daily foreign exchange returns to be non-linear and symmetrically U-shaped. Specifically, we observe pronounced negative autocorrelation for moderate USD appreciations and depreciations (central quantiles). For extreme positive and negative USD movements, we detect positive autocorrelation. This symmetric non-linear form of temporal dependence is remarkably stable across different exchange rates and states of the market. It appears to be a unique feature of foreign exchange returns and might be related to the fundamental \u00e2\u0080\u0098two-sidedness\u00e2\u0080\u0099 of foreign exchange markets.",

Our results demonstrate that the volatility is persistent only in daily returns but not in weekly and monthly returns. Similarly, asymmetries were observed for daily returns implying that news arriving in the market continuously does impact investors' sentiment and behavior. However, this phenomenon subdues when the period is extended, reflecting that PSX is efficient in semi-strong form. These findings have important implications for asset management, instrument pricing, cost of capital estimations, and portfolio optimization.",

        "abstract": "This study focuses on China's A-share market and investigates the existence and underlying source of the illiquidity premium. We observe a significant and positive relationship between stock illiquidity and expected returns. Moreover, relative to illiquid stocks, liquid stocks are more susceptible to overpricing during high sentiment periods and earn lower abnormal returns following high sentiment periods, thus supporting the sentiment-driven mispricing explanation. We also find evidence that the illiquidity premium fails to reflect exposure to underlying risk. Overall, China's illiquidity premium derives from mispricing instead of risk-taking.",

These results are confirmed by Fama-MacBeth regressions. The positive premiums for the overnight and close-to-close periods are particularly evident for illiquid stocks and small firms. Further analysis indicates that it is positive jump returns, rather than negative jump returns, that primarily drive the positive (negative) overnight (intraday) return, as investors in the Chinese stock market tend to prefer buying winners.

Specifically, using return skewness as a proxy for lottery stocks, we find that buying stocks in the lowest skewness quintile and selling the highest earns a significant risk-adjusted return of 0.85% per month for stocks far below their 52-week high prices. By contrast, it earns an insignificant return of 0.04% per month for stocks close to their 52-week high prices. Moreover, high arbitrage risk and investor sentiment strengthen the effect of anchoring on gambling preference. Our findings are robust after considering the effects of capital gains overhang, under-reaction to news, firm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ownership status, and China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s non-tradable share reform.",

This study conducts a case study on one such market (Australia) and demonstrates that different methods of portfolio formation lead to different conclusions. For example, previous studies in Australia find evidence of the value premium only being present in the largest stocks, in contrast to the results from the US market. However, we find a value premium that is systematic across all size categories and generally increases inversely with size. Further, we find the well-documented size premium largely disappears once portfolios are formed that better represent feasible investment sets and once \u00e2\u0080\u0098penny dreadfuls\u00e2\u0080\u0099 are removed.

We find that, as a group, individual investors are less informed about imminent corporate earnings announcements and the related value implications. Domestic institutions with better local connections have access to privileged information, resulting in significant trading profits in the pre-event window. Informed domestic institutions tend to employ large-sized orders to take up all of the available liquidity. Although limited in terms of private information, foreign institutions with superior expertise accrue profits by trading conservatively through the use of small- to medium-sized orders and less aggressive prices. Order flows are more serially correlated in the pre-event period, especially medium-sized orders from foreign institutions.

Furthermore, we investigate the joint effect of sentiment and accounting information on stock price and highlight the asymmetric effect of investor sentiment and the moderating effect of information uncertainty. The empirical results show that investor sentiment can change both the expected earnings growth and the required rate of return, thus affecting the stock price. However, the sentiment effect during pessimistic period is evidently different from that when sentiment is relatively high, especially for the required rate of return. In addition, accounting information and investor sentiment can both explain the stock price. However, accounting information is more reliable for stocks with stable earnings, whereas investor sentiment has evident asymmetric effect on stock price and should receive more focus for stocks with high information uncertainties.",

Using the measure of information discreteness (ID) to identify the information flows of stock prices, we find that higher magnitudes of earnings surprises tend to occur in firms that attract less investor attention. Taking advantage of this observation, we confirm the prediction of the underreaction hypothesis by showing that earnings momentum profits are higher among stocks with more continuous information that is ignored by investors. Further, we propose that price limits are related to ID because they represent attention-grabbing events. We examine a modification of ID by considering the effect of price limits to explicitly isolate the continuous information from the discrete information. The evidence based on this modification provides more robust support for the underreaction hypothesis and rejects the overreaction hypothesis in explaining the profitability of the earnings momentum in Taiwan.",

        "abstract": "In this study, we examine the information diffusion of firms in investor networks. Using a unique investor account-level dataset from the Taiwan Stock Exchange from 2005 to 2014, we identify the information diffusion of firms as their centralization in investor networks. Consistent with the theory of investor information networks, we find that central investors trade earlier and are more profitable than peripheral investors. Furthermore, they have greater access to superior, private information based on actual M&A events. More importantly, we find that centralized firms (i.e., firms with more central investors' networks) experience less delay in prices, and therefore demand lower price delay premiums than peripheral firms. These results suggest that investor networks speed up the incorporation of new information into asset prices, and cause the strength of information diffusion to have a great impact on stock returns.",

        "title": "The high-volume return premium and changes in investor recognition",
        "abstract": "The phenomenon of high-volume return premium is generally attributed to the visibility hypothesis proposed by Gervais et al. (2001) based on the theoretical framework of Miller (1977) and Merton's (1987) investor recognition hypothesis. However, no existing empirical study has directly tested the visibility hypothesis due to the lack of high-frequency shareholding data. In this paper, we utilize the unique daily shareholding data for stocks listed on the Australian Stock Exchange to directly test this hypothesis by examining the relationship between the high-volume return premium and changes in investor recognition. We find that high-volume shocks do attract more investor attention and increase the investor base on the date of, and following, the shocks. This provides direct empirical evidence in support of the visibility explanation for the high-volume return premium. We also find that institutional and individual investors attend to different kinds of stocks; stocks attracting more institutional (individual) investors outperform (underperform) subsequent the volume shocks and exhibit a higher (lower) high-volume return premium. Our findings shed new light on the visibility hypothesis by showing that recognition/attention from institutional or individual investor is also crucial in determining the extent of the high-volume return premium and may help to reconcile the existing mixed empirical evidence across international markets.",

Using signed volume to proxy for the level of continuing overreaction, we show that the strategy that buys stocks with upward continuing overreaction and short sells those with downward continuing overreaction generates both intermediate-term continuations and long-term reversals in this market. The evidence is consistent with the prediction of the model based on investor overconfidence and biased self-attribution in predicting future stock returns. We further examine the impact of price limits on this overreaction-based return predictability by isolating the information embedded in signed volumes for limit-hit and non-hit days, respectively. The findings indicate that the imposition of price limits seems to restrain investors' overreaction behavior and that trading volume in non-hit days is a cleaner measure to capture the level of investor overconfidence in generating intermediate-term continuations and long-term reversals.",

Using the slope of the option implied volatility smirk as a proxy for the risk of large downward price moves, we find that market jump risk helps explain variations in basis.

After separating downward jump risk into unexpected and expected jump risks, we find that unexpected downward jump risk affects the basis, while no convincing evidence supports the expected downward jump risk effect. The downside jump risk effect is robust even when using the implied volatility skew and the return of a constructed jump risk-mimicking portfolio as proxies for downward jump risk and excluding the sample period from the 2008 financial crisis.",

To determine whether Islamic or market-wide factors better explain the cross-section of returns, we evaluate their performance with the CAPM (Sharpe, 1964), Fama and French (1993) three-factor model, Carhart (1997) four-factor model, and Fama and French (2015) five-factor model. Only 27 of the anomalies prove profitable. The five-factor model copes best with the cross-section of returns, confirming its superiority over other models. The Islamic factors better explain the cross-section of returns than the market-wide factors, pointing to at least a partial market segmentation. The results are verified by a batter of additional tests, including cross-sectional regressions, examination of one-way and two-way sorted portfolios, tests for monotonic relationships, and factor redundancy checks.",

This study found that retail short-sellers in Taiwan can predict stock prices and perform better with stocks held primarily by retail investors with a preference for lottery-like payoffs. Moreover, short-sellers make lower profits with stocks with lottery features in the absence of the uptick rule. The findings are robust when considering the effect of institutional short selling, alternative lottery-like measures such as retail trading activity, arbitrage risk, and distinct macroeconomic conditions. Overall, the results suggest that retail investors are not necessarily noise traders. Based on divergence-of-opinion theory (Miller, 1977), heterogeneous retail investors make trades due to their differences in sentiments. Meanwhile, retail short-sellers include professionals in profitmaking through short-selling by gauging the gambling propensity of general retail investors. Consequently, removing short-selling restrictions can increase the spillover effect of short-sellers' trading signals and help other retail investors move and adjust their investments in lottery-like stocks.",

The American SP-500 and the German DAX-30 are involved. In both cases the index is beaten by simple buy and hold strategies containing riskless assets and short options. This finding may be interesting to practitioners and theoretically relevant. Firstly, the market can be beaten in an orthodox way, since results of Financial Economics inspire the methodology.

In contrast with the recent literature showing that pair-trading strategy returns are insignificant and negative in the Taiwan stock market, we find that the profitabilities of pair trades developed by positions in the Taiwan 50 Index during 1990/1\u00e2\u0080\u00932016/3 present significant annualized mean returns of 1.84%\u00e2\u0080\u00933.04%. Moreover, thresholds with different stringent degrees, industry boundary, and alternative reinvestment mechanisms are unable to help pick out more profitable pair-trading portfolios. The distance filter and shorter trading-day setting are more reliable for pair trading. Finally, the deregulation on short selling results in more pair-trading activities, which obviously diminish the profitability of a pair-trading strategy.",

These stocks may be the result of the herding behaviors of individual investors who account for over 80% of investors in China's stock markets. Second, negative weekly returns increase in trading the constituent stocks of DJ30 and FTSE100 because returns increase considerably on golden-cross days as a result of stock price overreaction. These results remain robust by concerning investors' risk aversion, and even high risk aversion as investors suffer losses. In addition, our findings imply that stock market overreaction and herding behaviors are incorporated into technical analysis.",

        "abstract": "The 52-week high price contains dual information in predicting future stock returns. On the one hand, investors are subject to the anchoring bias by viewing the 52-week high price as a reference point; on the other hand, the effect of the 52-week high price is stronger if it happened more recently, which is known as the recency bias. This paper examines the role of the 52-week high in explaining momentum profits in the Taiwan stock market by comparing two strategies that are related to anchoring and recency biases, respectively. We show that the profitability of the 52-week high strategy is attenuated by the considerably negative returns in January months, while the profitability of the recency strategy is not sensitive to the January seasonality. However, the recency strategy still displays predictable time-series patterns when conditioning variables are taken into consideration. It is profitable only during periods before 2000, expansionary periods, and up market states. Further investigations show that when all strategies are considered simultaneously, the 52-week high strategy plays a determinant role in generating momentum returns during the sample period from January 1982 to December 2012, while the recency strategy dominates the momentum profits in the 1970s. Overall, our results reveal mixed evidence for both strategies, suggesting the coexistence of the anchoring bias and the recency bias in the Taiwan stock market.",

Such underperformance is persistent in subsequent months, although the underperformance is significant only in several months. In general, high MAX REITs are smaller and exhibit lower prices and higher idiosyncratic volatility than other REITs. However, firm characteristics cannot explain the MAX effect among REITs.

Although, some of the events in our sample experienced high negative returns, most events do not have statistically significant abnormal returns (ARs) for the event day (t=0).For longer event windows, from the event date to 5 days following the event (t= + 5) and from the event date to 10 days following the event (t= + 10) the cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) are calculated. CARs are higher than the event day ARs for most of the events. This implies that the stock market continued to decline the following days.On the other hand, the volatility models used for the analysis revealed that Turkish stock market is sensitive to terrorist attacks.",

        "abstract": "Economic return and volatility spillovers of derivatives markets on a number of assets have been extensively examined in the general economics literature. However, there are only a limited number of studies that investigate such interactions between freight rates and the freight futures, and no studies that also consider potential linkages with freight options. This study fills this gap by investigating the economic spillovers between time-charter rates, freight futures and freight options prices in the dry-bulk sector of the international shipping industry. Empirical results indicate the existence of significant information transmission in both returns and volatilities between the three related markets, which we attribute to varying trading activity and market liquidity. The results also point out that, consistent with theory, the freight futures market informationally leads the freight rate market, though surprisingly, freight options lag behind both futures and physical freight rates. The documented three-way economic interactions between the related markets can be used to enhance budget planning and risk management strategies, potentially attract more investors, and thus, improve the liquidity of the freight derivatives market.",

        "abstract": "Heterogeneous agents\u00e2\u0080\u0099 model with the stochastic beliefs formation is considered. Fundamentalists rely on their model employing fundamental information basis to forecast the next price period. Chartists determine whether current conditions call for the acquisition of fundamental information in a forward looking manner rather than relying on the past performance. It was shown that implementation of the agents memory can significantly change the preferences of trader strategies. The Worst out Algorithm (WOA) is used with considered heterogeneous agents\u00e2\u0080\u0099 model to simulate more realistic market conditions. The WOA replaces periodically the trading strategy that has the lowest performance level of all strategies presented on the market by the new one. The memory length of the new strategy that enters the market has the same stochastic structure as the initial strategies. This paper shows an influence of the agent memory as a stochastic process on the heterogeneous agents model with the WOA. Simulations show difference in price returns behaviour between two types of agents\u00e2\u0080\u0099 memory length distribution functions (Uniform and Normal). There is a significant difference in the values of the Hurst exponent and the variance in these two cases. A lower Hurst exponent in the uniform case is caused by a richer spectrum of agents\u00e2\u0080\u0099 memory length, because agents are equally distributed across all trading horizons. For the uniform case there is no opportunity for any prediction. On the other hand, the value of the Hurst exponent gives a signal for a possibility of the price prediction in the normal case.",

Low-turnover credit-risk-focused strategies have much higher capacities that can be further increased by constraining portfolio rebalancing in realistic ways.

Fragility is measured by the Fragility Index developed by Berger and Pukthuanthong (2012) and market stress is based on several economic variables. Results show that incorporating both market stress and fragility improves the information content of a risk measure. Our risk measure relates to poor subsequent monthly market returns.

Further, the most-unfavorable news creates price drift, and we document that selling stocks short in the wake of unusually-bad news yields annual abnormal gross returns greater than four percent.",

This provides a unique opportunity to study the nature and source of information embedded in each metric. Our empirical findings are consistent with short sellers being heterogeneous with respect to their information. Short flow is strongly related to recent returns and buy-order imbalance, and both anticipates and reacts to price-relevant announcements. In contrast, short interest is related to the mispricing of firm fundamentals. The distinct differences in the nature of information embedded in the two metrics provide an economic rationale for both the unique ability of each metric to predict returns and the future horizons over which the information is relevant.",

This explains some conflicting results in prior literature. Further, the expected persistence in trading intensity explains the majority of the autocorrelations in the level and the conditional variance of price change; helps predict hourly patterns in returns, variance and the bid-ask spread; and differentiates the price impact of buy versus sell and continuing versus reversing trades.",

More than 75% of the firms that would have been effectively downgraded ex post rightfully acquired a third Fitch rating ex ante. This decision prevents 67% of these firms from being downgraded from their original broad rating categories. Furthermore, having a third rating is attractive to investors only for bonds near a downgrade. Investors increase the holdings of these bonds and trade them more actively after the Lehman event.

However, recent studies show that this positive relation disappears when using out-of-sample EGARCH models to generate the forecasts. We show that expected IVOL proxies used in the prior literature are noisy and propose using combinations of out-of-sample IVOL forecasts generated by different EGARCH models that pass basic diagnostic tests. For the sample for which these high-quality proxies can be created, we find a significant positive relation with returns.

Our empirical evidence shows that intraday momentum persists only when the net gamma exposure of VIX options is negative and the effect weakens when European investors are away from the market, supporting our proposed explanation. Strikingly, we also find that trading strategies based on intraday momentum can generate an average annualized return of up to nearly 18%.",

For this purpose, we generalize the concept of component shares and information shares to allow for state-dependent relevance of different markets over time. Instead of using a linear vector error correction model (VECM) to construct the component shares and information shares as it is common in the literature, we employ a Markov-switching VECM with time-varying adjustment behaviour and state-dependent covariance matrices. Simulation results confirm that state-dependent component shares and information shares can be estimated consistently within this framework. We apply our approach to spot and futures prices for different stock indices such as EuroStoxx50, FTSE100, Nikkei225, and SP500. We find a clear state probability pattern over the trading day that closely resembles the well-studied volatility smile and might be related to the presence of heterogeneous agents in those markets.",

We utilize millions of Chinese business news articles and develop a flexible and innovative algorithm to identify linkages among listed firms. We find that news co-mention momentum spillover is stronger than others, unifying various forms of momentum spillover effects in the Chinese market and replacing the role of analyst co-coverage in the U.S. News co-mention identifies a wide range of economically important linkages, particularly recovering more cross-industry linkages than other link identification methods, which contributes to its strong performance.",

Neither risk factors, firm-level momentum, nor industry-level momentum can explain concept momentum. Furthermore, we find that both the underreaction and cross-stock lead-lag effect channels can cause slow information diffusion and drive concept momentum. Moreover, the concept momentum effect is stronger for relatively ambiguous concepts, for concepts that attract less investor attention, and following high-sentiment periods.",

Therefore, this topic is reexamined in the context of Thailand. In a sample of 50 repurchase rate announcements of the Bank of Thailand during 2003\u00e2\u0080\u00932009, our regression results suggest that the raw change in the repurchase rate has a negative effect on stock returns at the market level, which is inconsistent with the literature. Contrary to the results of numerous studies, we find that at the market level the expected change in the repurchase rate has a negative effect on stock returns and the unexpected change in the repurchase rate exhibits no effect on stock returns. However, the effect of the unexpected change in the repurchase rate on stock returns is evident at the firm level. Our findings also suggest that the stock market's response to the repurchase rate change is asymmetric. The unexpected change in the repurchase rate that is considered as good news has a negative effect on stock returns. Overall, the evidence lends support to the notion that the monetary policy announcements have a significant effect on stock prices and further adds to the debate on whether the creditability of the monetary authority may contribute to the stock market's response to the monetary policy actions.",

We propose a Kalman-filter-based methodology that allows us to deconstruct price series into the true efficient price and the microstructure noise. This approach allows us to employ volatility estimators that achieve very low Root Mean Squared Errors (RMSEs) compared to other estimators that have been proposed to deal with market microstructure noise at high frequencies. Furthermore, this price series decomposition allows us to estimate the variance covariance matrix of n assets in a more efficient way than the methods so far proposed in the literature. We illustrate our results by calculating how microstructure noise affects portfolio decisions and calculations of the equity beta in a CAPM setting.",

Using formal cojumping tests this paper considers the cojumping behavior of spot and futures prices in high frequency US Treasury data.

We find that the probability of cojumping is altered by the presence of an anticipated macroeconomic news announcement. The probability of cojumping is particularly affected by news surprises in non-farm payrolls, CPI, GDP and retail sales. However, the two cojumping tests are also more likely to provide contradictory results in the presence of surprises in non-farm payrolls.

To control for the effect of shorting limitations on mispricing, we further examine prices during the short-sale ban in 2008.

Classification of cryptos as an asset is one important issue while another crucial topic is the significantly high return and volatility fluctuations which does not make life easier for portfolio investors. High energy consumption to produce cryptos and carbon emission issues are also not developing the favor of cryptocurrencies. Moreover, in financial literature recent studies show that prices of renewable energy stocks have long-term cointegrating relationship with technology companies. In this context first we employ an asymmetric VAR-GARCH model to study spillover effects between major crypto-currencies, clean energy, and technology indices. Using daily data of the two major cryptocurrencies for the period of 1/1/2016 and 30/09/2021, we relate risk and return of different mean-variance portfolio strategies to Bitcoin (BTC), Etherium (ETH), S&P Global Clean Energy Index (SPGCE) and MSCI World Information Technology Index (MSCIWIT). Secondly, we apply the Markowitz mean-variance framework to assess risk-return benefits of cryptocurrency-portfolios. Our main goal is to offer optimal portfolio allocation approaches including cyptocurrencies with traditional financial assets. We will combine cryptocurrencies, clean energy, and technology indices to maximize return and Sharpe ratio. Furthermore, we will use our asymmetric VAR-GARCH models results to understand and cross check the Markowitz portfolio allocation results in details.",

        "abstract": "This study investigates the linkage between oil price index and stock price index in six GCC countries in two folds. Firstly, it studies the long-run relationship linking the stock price Index (SPI) and the oil price Index (OPI) for the time span, beginning February 2002 to May 2015. After confirming the dependency of the SPI across cross-sectional units for the six GCC countries three types of panel cointegration tests were used. Pedroni; Kao which is an Engle-Granger two step residual based test, and Fisher which is a combined Johansen test. Secondly, it investigates the linear short-run effect of oil price index shocks on these markets by using bootstrapped resample residuals. The findings reveal a robust long-run relationship amid OPI and SPI of six GCC country members. Furthermore, the linear short-run results indicate significant and positive consequence on Oman, Qatar, and UAE of oil price index shocks. The findings also indicate that Qatar is the most oriented market for the oil price changes within a short time period.",

        "abstract": "The real estate investment trusts (REITs) have an important role in the development of the real estate sector. For investors, the REITs are financial institution that offer service such as professional portfolio management, risk reduced through diversification, and utilization of scale economies. The REITs offer new opportunities for investors by making liquidity high securities the real estate properties in their portfolios. In this paper, the performances of firms traded as the REITs in borsa istanbul (BIST) during July 2005 - June 2016 are investigated by employing 4 different regression models (the capital asset pricing model, Fama-French 3 factor model, FF Four F model, and FF five F model. In this manner, regression model is estimated in which returns of the REITs are used as dependent variable; whereas market premium, size premium, value premium, profitability premium, and investment premium are used as independent variables. The Jensen Alpha which is a risk-adjusted performance measure is estimated as fixed term (alpha) between related returns and factors in regression equation. Positive alpha value refers to the risk-adjusted high performance, while negative alpha value refers the risk-adjusted low performance. It is also tested whether the alpha value is different from zero in performance appraisal. Empirical findings suggest that the alpha coefficient is not statistically significant in four different regression models. This result indicate that the REITs do not seem to over perform than market premium, size premium, value premium, profitability premium, and investment premium during the analysis period. Thus, analysts or investors will be able to estimate expected returns by considering these premiums.",

The analysis reveals a persistent and large value premium in the early 2000s, while after the financial crisis the premium diminished considerably. The excess return provided by value stocks was marked and persistent only in case of smaller firms, while in case of large-cap stocks the phenomenon was limited and present only in the early years of the 21st century. Finally, the analysis suggests that value stocks are not particularly riskier than growth stocks. Therefore, it seems that, at least in part, the value premium in the Italian market may present a mispricing explanation.",

In addition, analysts tend to be excessively pessimistic about value stocks and over optimistic about glamour stocks. We find that both positive earnings surprises and negative earnings surprises significantly affect subsequent returns. However, negative earnings surprises have less impact on value stocks relative to glamour stocks.

The paper uses three characteristics, namely size, book-to-market ratio and financial leverage to sort the most active stocks into corresponding characteristics mimicking portfolios. We examine how volatility of single characteristic mimicking portfolios as well as double characteristics mimicking portfolios respond to volatility in macroeconomic variables. The results indicate that the money supply volatility is the dominant source of volatility for the characteristics-sorted portfolios, followed by the inflation volatility. Both investors and policy makers should consider the volatility of money more than the interest rate channel in rebalancing their portfolios and formulating policies. Arguably, the low-frequency volatility of many portfolios tend to decrease during periods of global financial crisis and political uncertainty post the Egyptian revolution in 2011.",

Using data from the First section of the TSE, the existence of a flight-to-liquidity during the 2008 share market crashes is clearly documented. The TSE differs from other major exchanges as price limit rules restrict the daily price movements of shares. It provides a unique setting to test if a flight-to-liquidity occurs even when price limit rules may reduce market liquidity and delay price discovery. This study shows that despite having different trading rules, a flight-to-liquidity occurred during times of market uncertainty as investors were less willing to hold illiquid assets and rushed to sell these assets. The results are robust for smaller crash days and for different proxies of illiquidity.",

Defining a scheme for state reduction of DC Framework, we show that it has a dependable hierarchical structure that permits for analysis of financial data.

Consistently with previous stock market studies, the bid-ask spread and market depth at the best bid and ask quotes are found to be major determinants of limit order market dynamics at ultra-high frequencies. Consistently with the microstructure approach to exchange rate determination, the signed transaction activity appears to be the main factor behind the limit order market dynamics at lower frequencies. Application of principal component analysis to the covariate indices of competing risks identifies five pervasive factors that capture 85% of the Reuters D2000-2 limit order book activity. The multifactor competing risks model substantially improves the quality of short-term probability forecasts for buyer- and seller initiated transactions, relative to popular moving average-type forecasting rules",

Complementarity in information acquisition can explain these anomalies. Because information has a high fixed cost of production, its equilibrium price is low when quantity is high. Investors all buy the most popular information because it has the lowest price. Given two identical asset markets, investors herd: asset demand is higher in the market with abundant information because information reduces risk. By lowering risk, information raises the asset's price. Transitions between low-information/low-asset-price and high-information/high-asset-price equilibria raise price volatility and create price paths resembling periodic frenzies.

Our results indicate that positive news improves the performance of the stock market and the trading of individual stocks, whereas negative news impedes them.

We find that the stop-loss momentum strategy provides exceedingly higher returns, the Sharpe ratio, and alphas in comparison to other benchmark momentum strategies. In the context of prospect theory, the stop-loss rules work as self-control for investors to realize losses, thereby controlling the disposition effect and as a result, investors can earn significantly higher payoffs. Furthermore, our results provide evidence that the stop-loss momentum strategy outperforms other momentum strategies in all market states. Finally, the robustness analyses reaffirm the importance of implementing the stop-loss rules in managing the downside risk of cryptocurrencies.",

In this model, the firm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s debt-to-asset ratio governs the elasticity of default probabilities relative to equity prices. I use a large dataset of S&P 500 firms and an extended timeframe (2008\u00e2\u0080\u00932019) to examine the model\u00e2\u0080\u0099s empirical implications. First, the firm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s corporate leverage enhances the transmission of pricing information from the stock to the credit default swap (CDS) market. Second, equity and credit markets are more likely to be co-integrated when firms employ a higher debt-to-asset ratio.

Under the effect of corporate leverage, the credit market attracts informed trading and arbitrage resources.",

Applying the trading strategy to the corresponding ETFs and index futures yields similar results.

We calculate TBVIXs in a model-free way using the market prices of five-, ten- and 30-year Treasury futures options over a sample of more than 20years. The empirical findings of this study reveal that changes in TBVIXs are positively correlated with changes in both Treasury yield rates and US non-fixed income and European equity-based volatility indices. Our analysis also shows that changes in Treasury yield rates Granger cause changes in TBVIXs and that past changes in TBVIXs help explain current changes in equity-based volatility indices (and vice versa). Finally, we find that TBVIXs fall following scheduled macroeconomic news announcements and that the response of TBVIXs to news releases depends to some extent on the magnitude and sign of the surprise in the announcement.

The relation weakens with stock illiquidity, whereas it strengthens when short positions originate from informed agents, such as hedge funds, active investors, and short sellers with high past performance. This supports our hypothesis that the relation is driven by information, not price pressure. We show that these results can be used to obtain diversification benefits.",

The analysis provides empirical evidence in support of the hypothesis that the impact of news on the volatility of ESG firms is larger for bad news, compared to good news. Employing an EGARCH framework, the analysis also finds that, in response to bad news, the observed volatility increases for small size ESG firms is lower compared to large and mid-cap ESG firms. The findings provide evidence of a slow response by small size firms to news in an ESG context.

        "abstract": "Understanding factor interplay is crucial for effective portfolio management and risk mitigation. This study delves into quantile return connectedness among theme factors in the US and Chinese markets through static and dynamic analyses. In our static analysis, we examine the raw, conditional, and aggregate connectedness across various conditional return quantiles. A bootstrap residual process is conducted to identify statistically significant results. Our findings reveal marked disparities in significant transmitters and receivers across different conditional quantiles. Furthermore, there are notable contrasts in significant results between raw and conditional connectedness measures. For different connectedness measures, we observe a U-shaped relationship between total connectedness and conditional quantiles, underscoring the varying degrees of interplay among theme factors under different market conditions. In the dynamic analysis, we evaluate the performance of the minimum connectedness portfolio (MCoP), built utilizing time-varying connectedness information. The MCoP, built using left-tail connectedness information, demonstrates superior performance compared to its peers \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the minimum conditional correlation portfolio and the minimum variance portfolio \u00e2\u0080\u0094 in terms of the Sortino ratio and cumulative returns. Our study holds substantial implications for asset allocation, risk management strategies, and policy formulation. It provides valuable insights for constructing robust portfolios and enhancing overall market stability.",

The results reveal that the hedging factor influences uncertainty via the market volatility channel. This study provides the first piece of empirical evidence indicating that risk-averse agents place meaningful and significant weight on the hedging factor in economic decisions.

        "abstract": "The purpose of this paper is to investigate the information transfer in the relation between stock prices and trading volume. While several theoretical models establish this relation, determining its direction remains an empirical question. Conventional linear approaches, such as Granger causality, provide only limited insights. Importantly, they do not take into account the nonlinear nature of this relation which is advocated by theoretical models of noninformational trading. Moreover, they cannot deduce the dominant direction of the information transfer. Both shortcomings can be addressed by relying upon the concept of Shannon transfer entropy. In an empirical application to a large sample of stocks, we employ this model-free measure and find: (i) A substantial amount of nonlinear information transfer across stocks, and (ii) this information predominantly flows from returns to trading volume growth. Thus, we present empirical evidence that the relation between these financial variables is in fact likely to be nonlinear.",

Several significant variables were identified, but the literature assumes that their impact is symmetric throughout the distribution of information shares. Using data from 25 companies listed in the five largest Euro-area stock markets, we examine possible asymmetries using an unconditional quantile regression model, while also expanding the number of possible drivers. We find that liquidity, trading costs, and the probability of informed trading have a higher impact on the middle quantiles compared to the tails, implying that changes in market quality are more important to the price discovery process when the competition among markets is high and less important when informativeness is biased towards one market. Also, we document that price discovery varies with market momentum (mostly positive impact), country risk (mostly negative impact), and financial stress (positive impact), showing a novel \u00e2\u0080\u0098flight-to-safety\u00e2\u0080\u0099 effect in price discovery.",

The result show that REITs network connectedness is dynamic and experiences an abrupt increase in the first wave of COVID-19 outbreak (2020Q1). We also observe a substantial abrupt decrease in connectedness during the success of vaccination programs (end 2021). The connectedness among assets is much stronger during COVID-19 than before. The REITs of Japan and Italy are net receivers of spillover and those of US and UK are net transmitters of spillovers before and during COVID-19. Conversely, the REIT of Canada and Germany (France) switches from net receivers (contributors) of spillovers before the pandemic to net contributors (receivers) during the COVID-19. Finally, we show that News Sentiment index, Geopolitical Risk index, Economic Policy Uncertainty index, US Treasury yield, and Stock Volatility index influence the spillover magnitude across quantiles.",

We find evidence that large proportions of the asset classes\u00e2\u0080\u0099 formation periods are followed by momentum periods, strongly supporting the momentum effect. In particular cryptocurrencies have significantly larger and longer momentum periods in all frequencies which we attribute to the lower derivability of their intrinsic value leading to a higher degree of noise traders in the market. A momentum trading strategy based on the identical approach outperforms a buy-hold strategy for both asset classes, while only cryptocurrencies have higher risk-adjusted returns and lower downside risks than a passive investment. We also find critical price levels during structural elements of the momentum period where the volatility shortly but intensively increases and consequently initiates a price impulse in the direction of the momentum.",

First, the dynamic results of TVP-VAR model show an asymmetric and crisis-sensitive connectivity with the S&P 500 stock market acting as the net transmitter of spillovers in the system. The S&P 500 index contributed significantly to the system during the COVID-19 pandemic process. Second, according to the results of QVAR method, the total connectedness index is more pronounced during bearish and bullish market, demonstrating the higher return spillovers during lower and higher quantile. Third, we analyze strong connectedness between the S&P 500 stock and commodity markets in upper and lower quantiles, evidenced bysignificantly high interdependence during extreme markets, resulting in limited opportunities for portfolio diversification. Finally, the results of hedging ratio show that VIX is the most efficient hedging asset against the risk of S&P 500 stock market.

We analyze the relationship between the ANSI and the market responses, which includes the returns, trading values, turnover ratios and volatility index, and the ANSI is divided into five regions. Our empirical results reveal that with an increase in the ANSI in the previous month, there is a corresponding increase in the trading value along with a reduction in the investor fear gauge of the Taiwan volatility index (TVIX). Granger causality tests indicate that both the weekly and monthly ANSIs could be leading indicators of market returns if the different regions of the ANSI are accounted for. In a potential application of our findings to portfolio management, we find that when the lagged term of the ANSI is classified in the highest regions, value-weighted portfolios comprising stocks with the highest market values, lowest price-to-book ratios and lower turnover ratios will earn the highest returns. The efficiency of the news sentiment in portfolio applications is consistent over time.

The intraday reactions to overnight developments are studied using cross-quantilograms, a new, flexible methodology that facilitates detailed insights into the quantile dependence between two time series. The results provide evidence for the existence of intraday reversals after overnight periods that carry very bad news, whereas the picture of the short-term reactions to very positive overnight returns is mixed. The observed rebounds concern extreme quantiles and occur with a short delay during the first part of the trading day. The study also shows that continuation and reversal effects are not mutually exclusive. The economic significance of the identified patterns is illustrated by analysing the performance of a simple contrarian strategy.",

The results show that the Shanghai A-share stock index has significant negative autocorrelations in the lower regime and has significant positive autocorrelations in the higher regime. It attributes that Chinese investors overreact and underreact in two different states. These results are similar when we employ individual stocks. Besides, we investigate stock return autocorrelations by different stock characteristics, including liquidity, volatility, market to book ratio and investor sentiment. The results show autocorrelations are significantly large in the middle and higher regimes of market to book ratio and volatility. Psychological biases can result into return autocorrelations by using investor sentiment proxy since autocorrelations are significantly larger in the middle and higher regime of investor sentiment. The empirical results show that predictability exists in the Chinese stock market.",

This approach shows that VIX derivatives carry different information about future variance than S&P 500 (SPX) options, especially during the 2008 financial crisis. I find that the segmentation is associated with frictions such as funding illiquidity, market illiquidity, and asymmetric information. When they are segmented, VIX derivatives contribute more to the variance discovery process than SPX options. These findings imply that VIX derivatives would offer a better estimate of expected variance than SPX options, and that a measure of segmentation may be useful for policymakers as it signals the severity of frictions.",

We investigate empirically the comparative influence of high and low frequency traders on the price process, and conversely the influence of the price process on the trading of high and low frequency traders. We find that high frequency traders have a particularly high success rate on each transaction, measured by the likelihood that the following price change will go in their direction as well as by the amount of time they have to wait to realize their gain, when trading against low frequency traders. Contrary to common wisdom, we find that high frequency traders\u00e2\u0080\u0099 activity does not induce volatility or jumps. In fact, it is their absence that is problematic: volatility and jumps are more prevalent in periods when they trade less intensely. Conversely, we find that spikes in volatility and jumps cause high frequency traders to trade less intensely, decreasing their provision of liquidity. Finally, looking at the market microstructure noise component to the price model, we find that higher level of noise generates trading opportunities for high frequency traders and lead them to increase their trading activity.",

Using the longest available data (January 1999\u00e2\u0080\u0093December 2023) on sectoral exchange-traded funds (ETFs) without overlapping constituents, we statistically estimate significant positive and negative month-of-the-year effects across nine sectors as well as the S&P500. We present a comprehensive analysis of which months exhibit statistically significant and persistent calendar anomalies within individual sectors using two sample periods. Where necessary, we capture volatility clustering in a number of ETFs to improve the efficiency of our estimators. We also check the stability of the estimated models to reinforce the generalizability of our findings. Inter alia, the findings suggest that eight out of nine sectoral ETFs consistently yield positive returns in April and/or November and/or December. In both sample periods, none of the ten ETFs (including SPY) exhibited a significant positive or negative calendar anomaly in the muted months of March, May, June, August, September, and October.

Using both Fama-Macbeth regressions and multifactor time-series regressions, we find that stocks with higher oil price uncertainty betas have significantly lower expected returns. This finding is consistent with the asset pricing implications of the demand of investors for stocks with high potential to hedge against oil price uncertainty. We further conduct an industry analysis and find that the negative association between the oil price uncertainty beta and expected returns is pronounced, primarily in the Manufacturing and Transportation & Communication industries. Moreover, we demonstrate that the return predictability of the oil price uncertainty beta cannot be subsumed by those of other oil-related betas and well-known macro-uncertainty betas, thus supporting that global oil price uncertainty is an independent source of systematic risk in the Chinese stock market.",

However, ESG rating disagreement creates a barrier to ESG investment. This study explores empirically how ESG rating disagreement affects the Chinese capital market based on rating data from six agencies. The results show that ESG rating disagreement has a significant negative impact on stock returns. Mechanism analysis indicates that ESG rating disagreement can lead to decreased investor sentiment and, subsequently, a drop in stock returns. Heterogeneity analysis reveals that this negative impact is more pronounced in non-state-owned enterprises, companies with higher average ESG ratings, and those with fewer institutional investors. Moreover, the governance dimension is the crucial factor driving the drop in stock returns. Therefore, investors and decision makers should consider comprehensive information from multiple agencies when assessing ESG ratings to help mitigate decision bias.",

Our empirical results confirm this prediction. In addition, we find that the significant profit of the 52-week high momentum following high-sentiment periods persists up to five years. Further investigations show that the strong persistence of the 52-week high winners (losers) is concentrated in stocks with higher (lower) earnings surprises, especially during periods following high sentiment.

This study uses Fama and French's (2015) 5-factor model to calculate the idiosyncratic volatility with data from the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) for 1980\u00e2\u0080\u00932016, and analyzes the effects of investors' risk appetite reflected by market-based, press-based, and survey-based proxies for investor sentiment on the relationship between expected returns and idiosyncratic volatility. The findings demonstrate that risk appetite plays a significant role in explaining and predicting variations in this relationship over time. Specifically, when risk appetite increases, there is a shift from safer to more speculative stocks that is translated into positive effect on the relationship between expected returns and idiosyncratic volatility. In contrast, a lack of appetite for risk has the opposite effect. The results are robust using different subsamples and econometric procedures.",

Among stocks with low arbitrage costs, the fundamental strength strategy is profitable only following high sentiment.

This study investigates the asymmetric and intertemporal causality among the stock returns, trading volume, and volatility of eight ASMs. Results based on the linear model reveal that return generally Granger cause trading volume. However, evidence from the quantile regression shows that lagged trading volume has a negative causal effect on returns at low quantiles and positive causal effects at high quantiles. This evidence is consistent with volume-return equilibrium models, disposition and overconfidence models, and information asymmetry models. The positive causal effects of volatility on volume support the dispersion of beliefs model. In contrast, intertemporal evidence of contemporaneous and lagged causal relationships from trading volume to volatility supports the mixture of distribution hypothesis, sequential information acquisition hypothesis, and dynamic efficient market hypothesis. Volume-return and return-volume causality dynamics are quantile-specific and therefore driven by market conditions. However, the volume-volatility causality is dependent on volatility regimes. The linear model results confirm how model misspecification can distort and even reverse empirical evidence relative to nonlinear models.",

These price changes are typically surrounded by active trading and/or risk transfer between different investors. Using aggregate net exchanges, flows from bond to equity mutual funds, in the US for a period 1984 until 2015, I empirically investigate retail investor behavior around FTS episodes. Overall, I find a reversal statistical relation between net exchanges and market excess returns. A one-standard-deviation shock to net exchanges leads to an increase of market excess return of 1.75%, of which 72% is reversed within 5 months. In particular, FTS episodes are preceded by periods where more risk averse investors, e.g. retail investors, rebalance their portfolios towards risky assets. A trading strategy that is based on signals from past net exchanges outperforms the market portfolio, significantly during FTS periods by 1.4% monthly. However, I find that the observed reversal relationship is not necessarily due to price \u00e2\u0080\u0098noise\u00e2\u0080\u0099 induced by uninformed trading. It is more reasonable that the sudden increase in market stress and selling of risky assets is caused by other demand/supply shocks driven by increased economic uncertainty.",

Additionally, from this decomposition, we estimate extreme dependence correlation matrix which is used in the measurement of portfolio risk. For a sample consisting of six assets (Bitcoin, Gold, Brent, Standard&Poor-500, Nasdaq and Real Estate index), we find that our methodology presents better results, in terms of normality and volatility of the tail index, than the Kolmogorov\u00e2\u0080\u0093Smirnov distance, and its unnecessary capital consumption is lower.

This is then used to investigate when the equilibrium zero-profit condition might be violated, which would lead to a preference for a particular order type. The resulting theoretical and empirical predictions of advanced microstructural pricing models suggest that limit orders should be preferred during periods of intense market activity, such as periods of high volume and short duration, when the price components are positively correlated, and during periods of less intense activity when the components are negatively correlated.",

This positive association is stronger when the length of non-overlapping holidays is longer, and when firms have a weaker connection to Hong Kong market. Moreover, our evidence reveals that investor distraction rather than sentiment during holiday periods may be the reason for this positive association.

The empirical evidence reported here suggests that uni-directional Granger causality is running from medium- and long-term government bond yields to short-term inflation expectations as measured by a survey among consumers. Moreover, there is bidirectional Granger causality among short-term interest rates and short-term inflation expectations among consumers. Additionally, interest rates and the sentiment data measuring inflation expectations can help to predict inflation rates. These findings are supportive for the Fisher effect and also seem to indicate that the bond market is quite efficient predicting inflation rates. Furthermore, some problems of more traditional tests of the Fisher hypothesis are discussed. In this context the role of financial deregulation in Australia is examined. Thus, the Lucas critique seems to be of some relevance testing the Fisher effect (see Lucas, 1976).",

Even using six cost-mitigation strategies, after transaction costs, volatility management of asset-pricing factors besides the market return generally produces zero abnormal returns and significantly reduces Sharpe ratios. In contrast, abnormal returns of the volatility-managed market portfolio are robust to transaction costs and concentrated in the most easily arbitraged stocks, those with low arbitrage risk and impediments to short selling. Moreover, the managed market strategy only provides superior performance when sentiment is high, consistent with prior theory that sentiment traders underreact to volatility.",

This paper shows that such investor disagreement provides a novel explanation for financial market dynamics around earnings announcements. We propose a rational expectations equilibrium model where investors disagree about the precision of a public signal, which separates a pre-news trading period from a post-news trading period. In equilibrium, investor disagreement about public signal precision diminishes informational price efficiency before the news, but enhances it afterward. Consequently, investor disagreement leads to a notable jump in informed trading around the news, a decline in abnormal trading volume before the news and a surge immediately after the news, and underreaction of stock price to announced earnings.",

We also find that institutional investors who overweight high crash probability stocks outperform the others, indicating that they have skill in timing bubbles and crashes of individual stocks.

It reaches beyond the widely employed studies based in the mean values of variables by resorting to the advanced quantile vector auto-regression methodology. The results show that the overall connectedness is stronger during extreme, either bearish or bullish market situations, than during normal market conditions. Furthermore, we show that all sustainability markets, except Japan, are the net transmitters of shocks, while all the green bonds are the net receivers. Moreover, we document that spillovers vary significantly over time and that extreme market conditions reduce the net spillover influences. The relative tail dependence analysis shows that the connectedness at the lower quantile relatively dominates the connectedness at the upper quantile. Finally, the total spillovers are higher at the extremes than at the median quantile, whereas the periods of major crises are associated with unusually high connectedness, as consistent with the literature on contagion effects.",

The benchmark correlation matrix results are obtained using the conventional Maximal Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transform (MODWT). We augment these results by testing the co-movement over time as well as across time horizons through application of the partial wavelet coherence, which marks departure from conventional wavelet coherence approach. The results obtained are noteworthy in several respects. Gold mining stocks and gold are found to be highly coherent, whereas gold mining stocks and equities indicate weak coherence. These results are useful for multi-horizon investors seeking assets with hedge and safe-haven property.",

However, very few authors have looked into the January effect after the financial crisis of 2008 and even fewer have used data of individual companies instead of indexes in doing so. This paper intends to fill this void by analyzing returns of individual micro-cap companies on the three biggest stock markets New York Stock Exchange, London Stock Exchange and Tokyo Stock Exchange for a time period January 2010 to January 2017. Analysis of each individual company using simple averages and regression analysis documented that abnormally high rates of return on micro-capitalization stocks are no longer present in the stock market in the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2008. Further confirmation of disappearance of January effect is conditional on new longer datasets as they become available.",

The study contributes to the discussion of how the emerging capital markets perceive the value of socially responsible activities undertaken by firms. The research indicates that events such as addition to and removal from a sustainability index (as well as announcements thereof) create a trading opportunity. Additionally, it suggests that investors at the Warsaw Stock Exchange \u00e2\u0080\u0093 at least in the short run \u00e2\u0080\u0093 tend to sell stocks of companies formally recognised as socially responsible",

        "abstract": "It is well known that augmenting a standard linear regression model with variables that are correlated with the error term but uncorrelated with the original regressors will increase asymptotic efficiency of the original coefficients. We argue that in the context of predicting excess returns, valid augmenting variables exist and are likely to yield substantial gains in estimation efficiency and, hence, predictive accuracy. The proposed augmenting variables are ex post measures of an unforecastable component of excess returns: ex post errors from macroeconomic survey forecasts and the surprise components of asset price movements around macroeconomic news announcements. These \"surprises\" cannot be used directly in forecasting--they are not observed at the time that the forecast is made--but can nonetheless improve forecasting accuracy by reducing parameter estimation uncertainty. We derive formal results about the benefits and limits of this approach and apply it to standard examples of forecasting excess bond and equity returns. We find substantial improvements in out-of-sample forecast accuracy for standard excess bond return regressions; gains for forecasting excess stock returns are much smaller.",

Our GE model includes fundamental information that first manifests at the micro level and is not symmetrically observed by all agents. This produces foreign exchange transactions that play a central role in information aggregation, providing testable links between transaction flows, exchange rates, and future fundamentals. We test these links using data on all end-user currency trades received at Citibank over 6.5 years, a sample sufficiently long to analyze real-time forecasts at the quarterly horizon. The predictions are borne out in four empirical findings that define this paper's main contribution: (1) transaction flows forecast future macro variables such as output growth, money growth, and inflation, (2) transaction flows forecast these macro variables significantly better than the exchange rate does, (3) transaction flows (proprietary) forecast future exchange rates, and (4) the forecasted part of fundamentals is better at explaining exchange rates than standard measured fundamentals.",

We find evidence that analysts outperform on their stock recommendations when they have an educational link to the company. A simple portfolio strategy of going long the buy recommendations with school ties and going short buy recommendations without ties earns returns of 5.40% per year. We test whether Regulation FD, targeted at impeding selective disclosure, constrained the use of direct access to senior management. We find a large effect: pre-Reg FD the return premium from school ties was 8.16% per year, while post-Reg FD the return premium is nearly zero and insignificant. In contrast, in an environment that did not change selective disclosure regulation (the UK), the analyst school-tie premium has remained large and significant over the entire sample period.",

Domestic retail investors have a greater presence in Chinese A shares, and foreign institutions are relatively more prevalent in B shares. These differences result from currency conversion restrictions and mandated investment quotas. We find that only B shares exhibit momentum and earnings drift, and only A shares exhibit monthly reversals. Institutional ownership strengthens momentum in B shares. These patterns accord with a setting where momentum is caused by informed investors who underreact to fundamental signals, and short-term reversals represent premia to absorb the demands of noise traders.

The excess return series for these countries are modeled using non Gaussian state space or unobserved component model that encompasses non normality and time varying volatility that might be present in the series. While statistically significant evidence of non-normality and volatility persistence does exist in most series, statistically significant persistent predictable component also prevails in Austria, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland excess returns. However, the results on possible existence of predictable components in stock excess returns in Croatia, Denmark, Greece, Hungary, Russia, Slovakia, and United Kingdom are in sharp contrast. The efficiently estimated excess returns range between 0.002 % per month for Slovakia to 0.094 % per month for Russia stock excess returns. The characteristic exponent ranges between of 1.632 for Croatia to 1.917 for France showing non-normal behavior in these series although the characteristic exponent of 1.999 shows a normal behavior in Italian and Russian excess return series.",

Short-term spillover is the largest proportion of total volatility spillovers. Furthermore, the uncertainty indices are net receivers of spillovers for different time horizons. Oil receives more spillovers than gold, indicating that the latter commodity is more immune to shocks emanating from G7 stock markets than the former.

        "abstract": "Abstract A properly performing and efficient bond market is widely considered important for the smooth functioning of trading systems in general. An important feature of the bond market for investors is its liquidity. High-frequency trading employs sophisticated algorithms to explore numerous markets, such as fixed-income markets. In this trading, transactions are processed more quickly, and the volume of trades rises significantly, improving liquidity in the bond market. This paper presents a comparison of neural networks, fuzzy logic, and quantum methodologies for predicting bond price movements through a high-frequency strategy in advanced and emerging countries. Our results indicate that, of the selected methods, QGA, DRCNN and DLNN-GA can correctly interpret the expected bond future price direction and rate changes satisfactorily, while QFuzzy tend to perform worse in forecasting the future direction of bond prices. Our work has a large potential impact on the possible directions of the strategy of algorithmic trading for investors and stakeholders in fixed-income markets and all methodologies proposed in this study could be great options policy to explore other financial markets.",

The major concern is to assess whether the presence of herd investing and the level of market inefficiency altered for the period between pre-first-lockdown (i.e., 23 June 2017\u00e2\u0080\u009322 March 2020) and post-first-lockdown (i.e., 23 March 2020\u00e2\u0080\u009315 February 2022). The generalized Hurst exponents are measured towards a multifractal detrended fluctuation approach. In particular, the empirical results document that multifractality exists for each NFT during the COVID-19 outbreak. Besides, the level of market inefficiency differs among the selected NFTs. The results refer to the case that the post-first-lockdown period is more prone to herd investing for Cryptokitties, Cryptopunks, and Decentraland. Furthermore, testing for MLM (inefficiency) index, the empirical findings show that Cryptokitties became more vulnerable in the post-first-lockdown period. Regarding the impacts of this far-reaching outbreak, the highest MLM (inefficiency) index value is attributed to Cryptopunks before the first lockdown and Cryptokitties after the first lockdown periods.",

The period of interest ranges between October 2001 and August 2006, coinciding with the beginning of an oil price surge following the low-price period of the 1980s and 1990s. Our empirical findings imply that the NYMEX futures market is not an efficient market in the Fama sense for the October 2001-August 2006 period.

Stock Connect, a cross-border investment channel between mainland China and Hong Kong, provides a natural testing ground. Investors are allowed to trade a list of qualified stocks from the stock market on the other side, and when a stock is removed from the list, investors can only sell but cannot buy that stock. We find that the inclusion of stocks is correlated with abnormal returns, implying downward-sloping demand curves for stocks. The effect weakens over time and disappears in about 40 trading days. There are no abnormal returns when stocks are removed from the list. On the other hand, when investors can only sell some stocks, they have a significantly higher propensity to sell. Their trading style becomes more contrarian for such stocks, and they tend to trade in small amounts. After 6 months, their investment behavior returns to that before the removal.",

        "abstract": "The stock market predictability has been a favorite topic of scholars and practitioners alike. It seems that some small predictability is present in all major stock markets worldwide. This predictability can be attributed to the risk premium structure and/or to inefficiencies present in the markets. This paper investigates the predictability of returns of some major shares listed in the London Stock exchange, using economic as well as accounting variables. We first measure the predictability of these variables by regressing individual stock returns on their corresponding accounting variables and the economic ones. Second, we estimate for the returns a seasonal latent factor model with time varying volatility. Provided that our measure of risk is an adequate one, the residuals of this estimation are free of the predictability of risk premium, and consequently one expects that any accounting and factor economic variables would have no predictive power. An LM-type test is developed and employed to indicate that indeed the U.K. stock market predictability is due to the risk premium structure, and the explanatory power of the variables considered here is due to them being an approximation of risk. However, when we perform the test jointly for all assets, we reject the zero predictability hypothesis at 5% but not at 1%.",

Concern that increased domination of capitalization weighted stock indices by a few large firms will lead to inefficient portfolio diversification is leading some investors and researchers to argue that index providers should adjust their weighting methods to limit concentration. This study tests and rejects the hypothesis that concentration arising as a result of capitalization weights in the FTSE 100 Index increases risk, either during normal market conditions or during negative tail events in the return distribution. On the contrary, during the left tail of the return distribution, the equally weighted portfolio of FTSE 100 Index constituents exhibits higher risk and lower returns than the capitalization weighted FTSE 100 Index portfolio, a finding consistent with variations of the CAPM that allow for time varying risk premia.",

High-to-price has a lower downside risk and higher Sharpe ratio than price-to-high. We find that a conventional momentum strategy combines the characteristics of high-to-price in a bull market and those of price-to-high in a bear market. In particular, the large drawdowns of momentum strategies reported in previous studies seem to be largely owed to those of price-to-high in bear markets.

Real estate markets are believed to be one of the causes of the Asian financial crisis and one of the most affected sectors as well. Overheating in property prices in the Asian region led to excess volatility in real estate prices and subsequently induced the crisis. Soon after the crisis, contagion and volatility spillovers spread over the East Asian region that increased volatility and reduced returns in real estate sectors. The paper investigates whether the excess volatility in the real estate markets led to volatility spillovers to stock markets and the other way around. Models of conditional volatility at multivariate level is employed to examine the return and volatility spillovers between the real estate and stock markets for five ASEAN countries, namely Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand. The results show evidence of the spillover effects between the real estate and stock markets from low to moderate degrees. The findings imply a better understanding and awareness for institutional investors in the international assets portfolio management and the respective governments to improve the financial prudential system to minimize the volatility effects from financial markets",

This phenomenon has been extensively discussed in the financial theory as well as practice and the first known theory of asset pricing leads back to as early as Bachelier (1900). The current study evaluates the performance of Fama and French Three Factor model in Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE). It employs a multivariate regression approach after sorting six portfolios on size and bookto market. The constituent stocks were selected to represent each and every sector of KSE. Daily returns were employed for a period of five years starting from January 2003 to December 2007. The six month Pakistan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s T Bill yield was used as proxy for risk free rate to determine excess returns. The excess returns for each portfolio were regressed on market, size and value factors. The results were encouraging for the three factor model. The three factor model was able to explain the variations in returns for most of the portfolios and the results remain consistent when the sample was reduced to control for the size effect. Our findings are consistent with most of the studies that suggested the validity of three factor model in emerging markets. These findings havesubstantial implications for fund managers, analysts and investors. The results suggest that size and value premium must be incorporated for asset valuations and portfolio management decisions.",

We seek to answer the research question whether following extreme events any overreaction of investors can be observed on the Budapest Stock Exchange. With a view to answering the research question, we identify extreme events based on extreme returns on the market portfolio and then - using an event study - we examine abnormal returns on winner and loser equities. After examining investors' reactions, we inspect the performance of the contrarian strategy in the created event windows. The main result of our research is the presentation that - based on the analysis of the differences between the average cumulative abnormal returns after extreme events - investor overreactions can be observed in the Hungarian stock market. The loser portfolios relating to extreme events significantly outperform winner portfolios connected to the event. The excess return of the contrarian strategy cannot be attributed to differences in the market risk of winner and loser portfolios. The excess return of the strategy can be shown only under tighter extreme value thresholds. The clustering of the event windows with short-term reversal, high market volatility and extreme events is beneficial to the performance of the contrarian strategy. In addition, our research also shows that the purchase of loser portfolios or the development of a contrarian strategy after extreme events may generate profit for investors, since after extreme events the loser portfolios usually beat the market on a horizon of 21 days.",

        "abstract": "A derivation of the ICAPM in a very general framework and previous theoretical work, argue for the relative risk aversion (RRA) coefficient to be both time-varying and countercyclical. The variables that represent proxies for the cyclical component of RRA are the market dividend yield, default spread, smoothed earnings yield and industrial production growth, all being highly correlated with the business cycle. In addition, the value spread - a proxy for the relative valuation of value stocks versus growth stocks - is included as a determinant of risk aversion. The results show that risk aversion is countercyclical, and the ICAPM with time-varying RRA performs better than the Bad beta good beta model (BBGB) from Campbell and Vuolteenaho (2004). The results from an augmented scaled ICAPM show that the market return has a negative effect on risk aversion, thus risk aversion seems to be affected by both business conditions and financial wealth. The estimates of the average RRA coefficient seem reasonable and plausible, and the model is able to capture a significant decline in risk-aversion in the 90's, in line with the mounting evidence from academics and practioneers. When compared against alternative factor models - CAPM, Fama-French 3 factor and Fama-French 4 factor models - the scaled ICAPM performs much better than the CAPM, and compares reasonably well against the Fama-French models. A crucial result relies on the fact that the scaled ICAPM models do a good job in pricing both the \"extreme\" small-growth portfolio and all the book-to-market quintiles, which is mainly due to the presence of the factor related with time-varying risk-aversion. Overall, the results of this paper offer a fundamental explanation - time-varying risk aversion - for the value premium. Preliminary results suggest that the ad-doc HML and UMD factors, at least partially, measure the same types of risks as the ICAPM with time-varying risk aversion",

In a globalized world, it is reasonable think that active finance is a deployed method to organize central economic variables. This determines variables that explain the behavior of actions by the industry oil from December 2012 through August 2015. We use regression of certain variables in accordance with their significance. The goal at this early stage, is to select significant macroeconomic indicators in determining the share prices of the sector in the market. Results demonstrate, through the application of econometric models, the relationship that exists between the price of financial assets and the macroeconomic variables selected for analysis.

        "abstract": "Abstract This paper investigates the relationship between trading volume and volatility for four international stock markets (US: S&P500, UK: FTSE100, France: CAC40 and Germany: DAX30) in a context of global financial crisis. Unlike previous related studies, we use intraday data and apply a nonlinear econometric model to assess this relationship. In particular, we first break down intraday realized volatility into its continuous and jump components using the non-parametric approach developed by Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard (J Financ Econom 4:1\u00e2\u0080\u009330, 2006). Second, we investigate the volume\u00e2\u0080\u0093volatility relationship and test whether it varies according to volatility components (jumps and continuous component). While Giot et al. (J Empir Finance 17:168\u00e2\u0080\u0093175, 2010), among others, investigated the volume\u00e2\u0080\u0093volatility relationship in a linear context, our study contributes by estimating different nonlinear specifications (threshold model, nonlinear Tobit model) that enable us to capture further asymmetry and time-variation to better apprehend the effect of trading volume on realized volatility. Accordingly, our study yields two interesting findings. On the one hand, as expected there is a significant and positive relationship between trading volume and realized volatility, as well as with its components, confirming the importance of trading volume as a key to characterizing volatility. On the other hand, we show that this relationship exhibits asymmetry and nonlinearity, and that threshold models are more appropriate than linear model to characterize the volume volatility relationship.",

        "abstract": "Abstract We analyze stock price behavior around reconstitutions of the German DAX index family from 1990 to 2013. The strong price run-up of added stocks in the 2 months preceding the announcement date remains robust until 2 months after the effective date (ED), and is fully reversed 5 months later. Conversely, stock prices of deleted firms are under pressure until 10 months after the ED. Unlike most previous studies, we find that outright entries and exits have temporary price effects, as do additions to and deletions from better-known indices; however, promotions and demotions related to lesser-known indices command permanent stock price responses. Rather surprisingly, deleted stocks consistently earn higher abnormal returns than added stocks in the 5-year post-event period. Specifically, the return differential levels out at 77.3%. We establish that this differential in permanent stock prices is attributable to differences in operating performance and media coverage. In practice, index reconstitutions do not appear to give unambiguous signals about the long-run investment appeal of affected firms. However, index fund managers not constrained by tracking error minimization would be better off holding deleted stocks for 5 years after the ED.",

This evidence provides fundamental support for studies in the literature of gradual information diffusion, commonly using lagged returns as a proxy for information. To allow for the possibility that firms react differently to the industry-wide earnings surprises, this study measures how a stock\u00e2\u0080\u0099s returns respond to the part of its main customer or supplier industry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lagged returns that are associated with earnings surprises.

The strategy tends to select medium-sized firms across industries.

Winners also experience positive responses to both positive and negative shocks while losers experience negative responses to both types of shocks.",

        "abstract": "Abstract VIX exchange-traded products (ETPs) provide tracking on the return of a constant-maturity VIX futures index, instead of the uninvestable VIX spot index. In this paper, we develop a comprehensive framework to dissect the tracking performance of regular and leveraged VIX ETPs. In this framework, na\u00c3\u00afve investors in VIX ETPs expect to achieve the ETP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leverage ratio multiplied by the VIX return during their holding period, but the actual ETP return can deviate dramatically from this na\u00c3\u00afve expected return due to four components of return deviation. The index substitution deviation is shown to be the primary driver of the bull (inverse) VIX ETPs\u00e2\u0080\u0099 return erosion (enhancement), which can be explained by the negative roll-yield as a result of the contango term structure of underlying VIX futures index. For leveraged VIX ETPs over multiple holding days, the compounding deviation due to the \u00e2\u0080\u009cconstant-leverage trap\u00e2\u0080\u009d can be sizable. In addition, the NAV deviation due to expense ratio and fund management issues is negative, and the inefficiency deviation doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t accumulate over long holding periods due to the creation/redemption feature. Our return deviation framework can be generalized to other ETPs tracking indices that are either uninvestable or unrealistic to replicate.",

Results suggest that the closer insiders are involved in daily business activities, the greater the predictive power of those insiders\u00e2\u0080\u0099 transactions is. In line with the literature, we reason and find that closely involved insiders are better at gauging future changes in cash flow realizations eventually affecting a firm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s default risk, because these insiders have greater access to in-firm information. The predictive power of aggregate insider trading doubles each time we increase the forecast horizon and each time when gradually increasing the level of default risk from BBB to CCC spreads. For the standard BBB\u00e2\u0080\u0093AAA spread, a univariate model explains up to 52% in annual credit spread change variation and is economically meaningful. An increase in one standard deviation in aggregate insider trading translates into a decrease of up to 72% of the standard deviation of annual credit spread changes. The predictive power of aggregate insider trading is neither just driven by the 2007/08 financial crisis, nor only by information conveyed from net purchasing or net selling insiders. Our results recommend portfolio and risk managers to take aggregate inside information and the heterogeneity among insiders into account when assessing future aggregate default risk.",

We find that, in general, IPOs do not underperform their peers when we adjust long-run abnormal returns for firm-level idiosyncratic risk. We also note that the idiosyncratic risk exposure depends on the IPO profile; it is more important for firms going public in hot-issue markets, undervalued IPOs and high idiosyncratic-risk issues.

Moreover, we find that the intensity of the volatility spillovers may change substantially in very short periods of time and that these shifts in spillover intensity can be linked to prominent economic events and financial market turmoil. Our results further demonstrate that value returns increase and momentum returns decrease monotonically with increasing volatility spillovers between the two strategies. Given this linkage between spillover intensity and returns, we propose a simple trading strategy which utilizes a volatility spillover index for allocating funds between value and momentum portfolios. The proposed trading strategy outperforms value and momentum strategies and generates payoffs that are not subject to option-like behavior.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Behavioral finance theory stipulates that the disposition effect plays an important role in inducing momentum. Using quantile regression analysis, this research is twofold. First is to examine the relation between the unrealized capital gains and expected returns. Second is to examine the capability of disposition effect as one of the underreaction models in inducing momentum in the most extreme quantiles (0.05th and 0.95th) of expected returns. To do so, we use a sample of 5176 firms, from January 1998 to June 2015. Following Grinblatt and Han (J Financ Econ 78:311\u00e2\u0080\u0093339, 2005), the findings show that the relation between unrealized capital gains and expected returns is significantly positive and decline as the quantiles of expected returns increase from the lowest to the median expected return quantiles. However, they become significantly negative and rise with the increase of expected returns quantiles above the median expected returns quantile. This indicates that disposition-prone investors exhibit disposition behavior below the median and median expected return quantiles, but they display the opposite behavior above the median quantiles of expected returns. Our findings also suggest that the disposition effect is not a good noisy proxy for inducing momentum at the lowest quantile of expected returns (0.05th). However, the disposition effect induces contrarian behavior at the highest quantile of expected returns (0.95th).",

It is found that when the high LHR is associated with positive shocks from the monthly revenue announcement, the stock becomes significantly less appealing to individual investors. As individual investors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 order imbalances drop substantially after the revenue announcement period, the modified MAX effect is diminished. We also find monthly revenues announcements greatly dilute the importance of quarterly earnings announcements and, therefore, play the more important role in determining the modified MAX effect. Overall, our study suggests that more frequent and promptly financial information disclosures, such as monthly revenue reports, are critical to improving market efficiency and reducing behavioral bias.",

By analyzing high-frequency data covering a twelve-year period, we discover that futures trading activity can be attributed to high-moment market risks, as observed in the significant explanatory power of realized high moments even after controlling for other risk factors. The results are robust to the use of various adjusted measures of high-moment risk, their subcomponents, various measures of trading activity, and data attributes. This study suggests that realized high moments are a market risk and cannot be combined with volatility risk and other risk measures. Most importantly, this study finds that there exists a flow of market information from price risk to trading activity.",

We find that the abnormal returns and the Sharpe Ratio are higher for actively managed mutual funds holding fundamentally strong stocks. These results are driven by the lower risk of stocks with strong fundamentals rather than higher returns. Compared to benchmark index funds, actively managed mutual funds do not slant their portfolios towards fundamentally strong stocks. The lack of trading on firm fundamentals appears to be related to manager incentives as fund inflows are uncorrelated with changes in the fundamentals of their holding stocks.",

We find that most anecdotally observed seasonal variations of yields do not pass the more rigorous statistical significance test. In addition, the seasonality findings depend on how me measure yields and what kind of seasonal patterns we test. No statistical significance is found with tests using nominal yields, most likely due to the fact that yields have been dropping substantially since the 1980s which distorted the mean values of yields. When we instead use the rank of monthly yields in a year to test the seasonality, however, we find strong statistical significance to support the variation of high yields from March to August and low yields from September to February",

Further analysis on the yield spread of the 10- Year and 2-Year T-Notes shows that although their nominal yield differences have been similar in recent economic cycles, the percentage values of the differences have been increasing quickly especially since the 2010s due to the low levels of short-term Treasury yields.",

We consider 34 exchange rates against the US dollar (USD) covering the period April 1991 to April 2006. The results suggest that 17 exchange rates show strong evidence of long memory. This indicates that shocks to the exchange rates persist over a long period of time (this is stronger in emerging market economies). This also indicates that these markets are not stable, and hence they offer an opportunity to investors and traders to add some risk to their strategies. The lack of long memory in the daily returns of exchange rates supports the efficient market hypothesis (EMH). These findings are helpful to traders dealing with long dated assets.",

We investigate the relationship between managerial skills and trading behavior within a two-period rational expectation equilibrium (REE) model where agents trade on private information in the first round, while a public signal arrives at the second date that makes traders revise their beliefs and retrade. The public signal can be related to the asset payoff, or to variables not related to fundamentals (noise), or both. We characterize the unique partially revealing REE and explore the drivers of price dynamics and trading behavior. Our main prediction is that good managers are contrarian traders, while bad managers are momentum traders when public news arrive to the market. Furthermore, the change in holdings of each type of trader is monotonic on the traders' skills. Based on these predictions, we propose new performance evaluation measures that rely on the manager's change in holdings around the arrival of public news rather than his past performance. A byproduct of our analysis is the proposal of a new protocol for performance evaluation and Due Diligence (DD) procedures.",

We group emerging markets into those with \u00e2\u0080\u009crobust\u00e2\u0080\u009d fundamentals (current account surpluses, high international reserves, and low external debt) and those with \u00e2\u0080\u009cfragile\u00e2\u0080\u009d fundamentals and, intriguingly, find that the exchange rates of the robust group (and, to a lesser extent, equity prices and CDS spreads) were more adversely affected by tapering news than the fragile group. The cumulative effects of tapering announcements after a month, however, appear to be quite similar for both robust and fragile emerging markets. We also show that more financially developed economies are more affected by tapering news, and a plausible interpretation is that more financially developed economies are more exposed, at least in the short term, to external news announcements.",

Following Fama and French factor approach, we sorted six portfolios by size and book to market. The sorted portfolios were constituted to represent stocks from each and every sector of KSE. Using Daily returns from January 2003 to December 2007, the excess returns for each portfolio were regressed on market, size and value factors. Our findings, in general, supported the notion of the three factor model. The three factor model was able to explain the variations in returns for most of the portfolios and the results remain robust when the sample was reduced to control for the size effect. Our findings are consistent with most of the studies that suggested the validity of the three factor model in emerging markets. These results warrant for the inclusion of size and value factors for valuation, capital budgeting and project appraisals, thus, having substantial implications for fund managers, analysts and investors.",

I document the informed trading is in the same direction of the realized returns in the 24-hour window before FOMC announcements, coinciding with the pre-FOMC uncertainty reduction. I integrate Kyle's (1985) model into a standard consumption-based asset pricing framework where the market makers are compensated for the risk of assets' fundamentals. Observing aggregate order flow, they update the belief about the marginal utility-weighted asset value, which resolves uncertainty gradually and results in an upward drift in market prices before announcements. I demonstrate that there is a strictly positive pre-FOMC drift if and only if the market makers require risk compensation.",

I argue that this evidence supports the hypothesis that the size effect is a consequence of market frictions and not a risk factor priced in equilibrium. High discount rates lower stock valuations and increase the overall book-to-market ratios in the market. They are also associated with the low risk bearing capacity, limited risk sharing and high uncertainty that increase market frictions. Ranking the years in book-to-market quantiles, as a proxy for discount rates, reveals that the size premium is usually statistically significant exclusively in the top book-to-market quantile. This evidence is robust to changes in the number of quantiles; in the US in different sub periods, and in the UK; considering both the Fama/French SMB factor or the individual size portfolios; and also controlling for market risk.",

        "abstract": "Objective - Previous research by this author has stated that the market overreaction phenomenon occurs in the Indonesian capital market and the CAPM (Capital Asset Pricing Model) is able to explain portfolio returns. However, CAPM is still debated along with the emergence of the other asset pricing models, such as the multifactor model proposed by Fama and French. The aim of this research is to test the ability of that model to explain the returns of portfolios formed under market overreaction conditions. Methodology/Technique - The data used in this study is the same as that of the previous research, which includes winner and loser portfolio data formed in market overreaction conditions, particularly on the Indonesian Stock Exchange, between July 2005 and December 2015. The multifactor models used include a three-factor model consisting of the factors of market, firm size, firm value, and a five-factor model with the added factors of profitability and investment. To obtain more accurate results, GARCH econometric models were also used in addition to standard test models for obtaining unbiased results. Findings - This research concludes that market factors (Rm-Rf), firm size (SMB), and firm value (HML), are able to explain the winner and loser portfolio returns well. However, when the factors of profitability (RMW) and investment (CMA) are added into the three-factor model, the RMW and CMA explained the returns negatively and inconsistently when the GARCH model is implemented.

Findings \u00c3\u00af\u00c2\u00bf\u00c2\u00bd The paper concludes that managers possess better market timing skill by obtaining more cost saving from their share repurchases when private information is reflected in stock price.

        "abstract": "This article presents a model for the determination of crude oil futures price that focuses on the activities of arbitragers and speculators. Arbitragers, who exploit cost of carry deviations, rely (in part) on commodity convenience yield to identify mispriced futures contracts. However, an important impediment to this process is obtaining timely information regarding marginal convenience yield as crude oil inventory changes. This study employs an unconventional measure of convenience yield that allows for inferring inventory changes directly from spot and futures prices of the commodity. The model is tested for three and six month West Texas Intermediate futures contracts. The results show a decline in the effectiveness of arbitrage activity during the sharp rise and fall in crude oil prices in 2008. Over the same period, it is found that speculation played a greater role in the determination of crude oil prices.",

Based on daily data from January 2000 to July 2017, cross-correlation function (CCF) provides four findings: First, volatilities of past trading volume and current return are correlated in pre- and post-crisis with an inconsistent sign, supporting the nature of noise trader demand. Second, in the pre-crisis period, both volatilities are negatively correlated within a short time span. Third, during the crisis period, there is no volatility spillover between both series. Fourth, in the post-crisis period, both volatilities of past trading volume and current return are positively correlated within a long time span, in addition to volatility spillover from the current return to the future trading volume which also happens within a short time span. Notably, significant volatility spillovers from trading volume to return across the crisis change the sign of correlations with a longer time span, supporting the \u00e2\u0080\u009cheterogeneity of traders\u00e2\u0080\u009d hypothesis.

Using a rich regulatory data set on S&P 500 E-mini futures, we show that this portfolio demand measure has a positive impact on prices. Decomposing our measure of portfolio demand into aggressive, passive and mixed components, we show that a one standard deviation increase in passive liquidity demand is associated with a 0.5 tick rise in prices for S&P 500 E-mini futures.

In addition, a non-gaussian factor model is estimated to extract a proxy of investor attention from Google search volumes of a set of keywords.

        "abstract": "Previous research in finance has found evidences of both overreaction and underreaction to unanticipated events, but has yet to explain why investors overreact to certain events while underreacting to others. In this paper, we hypothesize that while market participants generally underreact to new events due to conservatism, the extent of underreaction is moderated by \u00e2\u0080\u009csurprise,\u00e2\u0080\u009d thus causing market participants to overreact to events that are highly surprising. We test our hypothesis using data from an in-play soccer betting market, where new events (goals) are clearly and exogenously defined, and the degree of \u00e2\u0080\u009csurprise\u00e2\u0080\u009d can be directly quantified (goals scored by underdogs are more surprising). We provide both statistical and economic evidences in support of our hypothesis.",

In particular, we focus on whether liquidity effects are more pronounced in periods of financial crises, especially for bonds with high credit risk, using a unique data set covering more than 20,000 bonds, between October 2004 and December 2008. We employ a wide range of liquidity measures and find that liquidity effects account for approximately 14% of the explained market-wide corporate yield spread changes. We conclude that the economic impact of the liquidity measures is significantly larger in periods of crisis, and for speculative grade bonds.",

Specifically, a simple portfolio strategy that takes advantage of this straightforward vs. complicated information processing classification yields returns of 118 basis points per month before transaction costs. Consistent with processing complexity driving the return relation, we further show that the more complicated the firm, the more pronounced the return predictability.

In contrast, the value-based strategy derives most of its profitability from taking long positions in high credit risk firms that survive financial distress and subsequently realize high returns.

Some classical methods are used to examine the features of stock returns and a little evidence against mutually independency, random walk of returns, and sub-martingale of stock prices is found. A notion of a new simple statistical test based on information set for judgement of market efficiency is proposed. Through hypothesis tests, evidence indicating inefficient markets around 2008, 2011 and 2018 under expected return theory is found. It is a new finding that SZSEC is more sensitive to information and therefore may be more appealing to investors than SSEC. Moreover, there is an another new finding that when market extends in size the degree of whole market efficiency declines. From the relationship between market efficiency and volatility, volatility is not a very good criterion for market efficiency but some rough rules can be concluded to help investors make their decisions on what time to conduct their own strategies.

The stock price does not fully adjust to the market value of stocks hoped by investors and does not adjust symmetrically in upturn and downturn, if and only if the market is not efficient, and moreover the market value generally diverts from the fundamental value of stocks even though the market is efficient. As an operational example, the Tokyo stock market is found to be inefficient during 1980-2005. The speed of price adjustment is asymmetric in the 80s but symmetric in the 90s and 2000s. The over-evaluation of the market value is remarkably observed in the 80s but not in the 90s and 2000s.",

        "abstract": "This study develops a new model-free benchmark of implied volatility for the Japanese stock market similar in construction to the new VIX based on the S&P 500 index. It also examines the stochastic dynamics of the implied volatility index and its relationship with realized volatility in both markets. There is evidence that implied volatility is governed by a long-memory process. Despite its upward bias, implied volatility is more reflective of changes in realized volatility than alternative GARCH models, which account for volatility persistence and the asymmetric impact of news. The implied volatility index is also found to be inclusive of some but not all information on future volatility contained in historical returns. However, its higher out-of sample performance provides further support to the rationale behind drawing inference about future stock market volatility based on the incremental information contained in options prices.",

        "abstract": "Does speculative trade reduce mispricing and help create efficient markets or does it drive prices further from fundamentals? We analyze betting exchange trading on 9,562 UK horse races in 2013 and 2014 to find out. Crucially, as each race is run, the fundamental value of bets is unambiguously revealed. We find that the volume of trade is predictive of fundamentals, suggesting that speculative trade is on average conducive to market efficiency. However, much of this effect is concentrated in the in-running period during races when, even without trade, asset fundamentals would be revealed seconds later.",

In summary, I find no evidence that the procedure generates a valid forecasting model of market premiums with persistently positive out-of-sample R2 in the full 1926\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009c2019 sample, especially since the Oil Shock (or early 2000).",

A majority of earlier studies conducted in developed countries show that dividend has a strong effect than retained earnings. The study examines whether this is consistent in the context of Nepal (or not) and the implication particularly to the banking and non-banking sector. To achieve the objective of the study, a descriptive and analytical research design has been administered. The secondary data are used to test this impact. In order to examine the impact of dividends on stock prices, a multivariate linear regression analysis has been implied in which current market stock price is taken as a dependent variable and four other variables namely Dividend Per Share (DPS), Retained Earnings Per Share (REPS), Lagged Price Earnings Ratio (P/E ratio) and Lagged Market Price Per Share (MPS) as the explanatory variables. This attempt has been made to test the dividends retained earning hypothesis and to examine the estimated relationship over the period of time. The overall conclusion drawn in this study reveals that, the impact of dividends is more pronounced than that of retained earnings in the context of Nepal. Dividend has a significant effect on market stock price in both banking and non-banking sector.",

        "abstract": "We successfully replicate the main results of Ang et al. (2006): Aggregate-volatility risk and idiosyncratic volatility (IV) are each priced in the cross-section of stock returns from 1963 to 2000. We also examine the pricing of volatility outside the original time period and under more recent asset-pricing models. With the exception of NASDAQ stocks, aggregate-volatility risk continues to be priced in the years following the Ang et al. (2006) sample period, and none of the more recent asset-pricing models we consider consistently accounts for the pricing of aggregate-volatility risk. The difference in abnormal returns between stocks with high and low IV decreases but remains significant out of sample. More recent asset-pricing models do not resolve the IV anomaly for the Ang et al. (2006) sample, but the four-factor model of Stambaugh and Yuan (2017) and the six-factor model of Barillas and Shanken (2018) resolve the anomaly out of sample and over the extended period of 1967 to 2016. Finally, both models eliminate the arbitrage asymmetry that Stambaugh et al. (2015) propose as an explanation of the IV anomaly.",

Using regression model with dummies, we find persistent evidence of day-of-the-week anomaly but disappearing holiday effect, turn-of-the-month effect and time-of-the-month effect. We also document no evidence of month-of-the-year anomaly and half-month effect. Our result for the month-of-the-year anomaly is consistent to the finding observed for the Jordanian stock market and that for the day-of-the-week anomaly to the Greek stock market .In addition, our finding regarding half-month effect is consistent with the US market. For the rest, we find inconsistent results with that in the international markets.

It is found that the country-specific component of index return variance can easily double during the week around an Election Day, which shows that investors are surprised by the election outcome. Several factors, such as a narrow margin of victory, lack of compulsory voting laws, change in the political orientation of the government, or the failure to form a coalition with a majority of seats in parliament significantly contribute to the magnitude of the election shock. Our findings have important implications for the optimal strategies of risk-averse stock market investors and participants of the option markets.",

The paper focuses, besides reviewing some important literature concerning this issue, on an empirical analysis taking into consideration 44 companies listed on Bucharest Stock Exchange based on pool data linear regressions. It is true that the most recent research state that there is an important evidence of a deterioration of the relationship between accounting information and stock prices. Although, the main findings of this paper consist in that there are certain aspects which should be further examined for a more reliable conceptual approach. In addition, it concludes that - even in the case of an emergent capital market as Bucharest Stock Exchange - it can be found mixed evidences to support the importance of financial information in portfolio\u00e2\u0080\u0099 management decisions.

Daily returns from the Databank Stock Index (DSI) over a 5-year period 1999-2004 were used for the exercise. Random walk (RW) and GARCH(1,1) models are used as the basis for our analysis. The GSE DSI returns series exhibit volatility clustering, an indication of inefficiency on the GSE. The weak-form efficient market (random walk) hypothesis was rejected for the GSE, meaning that the market is inefficient. The inefficient market has important implications for investors, both domestic and international. Knowledge of profitable arbitrage opportunities due to market predictability serves to attract investors to diversify from more efficient markets to invest on the GSE bourse to increase their returns.",

We study a single-beta conditional model and we show that stock market risk premium is variable over the time and is important for capturing predictable variations of stock returns.

In particular, we assume that each speculator follows his own technical and fundamental trading rule. Moreover, a speculator's choice between these two trading philosophies depends on his individual assessment of current market circumstances. Our agent-based model setup is able to explain a number of important stylized facts of foreign exchange markets, including bubbles and crashes, excess volatility, fat-tailed return distributions, serially uncorrelated returns and volatility clustering. A stability and bifurcation analysis of its deterministic skeleton provides us with useful insights that foster our understanding of exchange rate dynamics.",

Therefore, using the daily individual stock\u00e2\u0080\u0099s return of 311 listed firms during an estimation period of 250 trading days; this research applies an Event Study Methodology to define the immediate stock market response to Covid19\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arrival in Bangladesh. Mean Return Model, Market Return Model, and Market model are applied to determine the Average Abnormal Returns and Cumulative Average Abnormal Returns for short term event window. Both Parametric and non-parametric tests of the significance of returns around the several event windows suggest that, despite the perceived weak market efficiency, the local stock market shows unprecedented efficient market reaction to the announcement. The significant statistical difference of CAAR between industry segments in both pre and post-event windows signifies that the negative impact of the announcement was identical for all industry segments. Behavioral overreaction induced Panic selling and herding effect has also been observed among investors due to the announcement. Findings from the study will be useful for investors and financial analysts in accessing the unpredictable systematic risk in portfolio diversification while facilitating policymakers to construct contingency strategy.",

It picks up where Blanco et al (2005) leave off but is focused on European credit markets. The study is based on companies listed in the iTraxx CDS index and thus on new data on a more liquid CDS market. Unlike previous studies, which look at price formation in a time-invariant context, the contributions of both markets to price discovery are analysed in a timevariant context. We devote particular attention to the question of whether such information input is stable in times of crisis and find that, although the CDS market slightly dominates the price discovery process, its contribution fell visibly during the turbulence on the credit markets in early 2005 in favour of that of the bond market.",

        "abstract": "For the DAX index market, this paper analyses the development of return differences between exchange traded funds (ETFs) and the DAX index from the perspective of long-term investors. The newly introduced methodology provides the opportunity to continuously identify long-term costs of passively managed products independent from the information of annual financial statements. This enables to test for product-specific return differences and to identify relevant cost drivers such as index returns and market makers. Results reveal that on average, DAX ETFs costs considerably exceed total expense ratios. Product-specific return differences are significant, however, differences tend to converge over time. For all ETFs, deviations are significantly influenced by index returns. Product characteristics deliver valuable arguments to explain these findings. Also market makers significantly contribute to return differences.",

It is found that the countryspecific component of index return variance can easily double during the week around an Election Day, which shows that investors are surprised by the election outcome. Several factors, such as a narrow margin of victory, lack of compulsory voting laws, change in the political orientation of the government, or the failure to form a coalition with a majority of seats in parliament significantly contribute to the magnitude of the election shock. Our findings have important implications for the optimal strategies of risk-averse stock market investors and participants of the option markets.",

Quantile regression analyses show that the widening effect of the stock trading volume on the distribution of spot returns disappears within a short period of time, whereas that of the futures trading volume remains over the long term. The short-term effect of the stock volume and the long-term effect of the futures volume are both consistent for contemporaneous trading volumes. Furthermore, the futures volume has a significantly positive effect on the option-implied volatility, whereas the stock volume is only associated with the implied volatility of at-the-money options, which can be traded quickly. In contrast, the implied volatility of out-of-the-money options, which are highly speculative, is strongly related to the futures volume. The findings suggest that the stock volume is mainly induced by hedging demand or disagreements of opinion, whereas the futures volume contains information about price movements.",

Alternatively, income measures in financial statements drive investors in stock markets to buy or sell in an intuitive way that can be also used in the stock-picking process to generate good profits in some markets. This study applies these types of information in the formation period to formulate long-short strategies and investigates both the returns and risk profiles in the holding period afterward and checks whether the measures can be used to generate good profits in the Taiwan markets for the period from January 1980 to June 2020. Given different lengths of the holding period and different equity segments, our empirical analysis shows that strategies filtered by the income measure of gross profitability outperform the counterparts filtered by the operating profitability. Moreover, while the momentum or contrarian effect is not, the size and value effects are helpful to improve the performance of long-short strategies filtered by gross profitability.",

This paper looks at the historic excess returns of different strategies across three countries and proposes several statistical and macro-based trading rules which seem to enhance returns even more. While riding based on the Taylor Rule works well even for longer investment horizons, our empirical results indicate that, using expectations implied by Fed funds futures, excess returns can only be increased over short horizons. Furthermore, we demonstrate that duration-neutral strategies are superior to standard riding on a risk- adjusted basis. Overall, our evidence stands in contrast to the pure expectations hypothesis and points to the existence of risk premia which may be exploited consistently.",

Our empirical results for US stocks show that this choice is very important for the risk-return characteristics of the resulting portfolios and their sensitivities to common risk factors. The weighting of stocks within the low-beta and high-beta portfolios and the chosen investment universe are essential design elements of low-beta strategies too.

Our analysis covers 149 U.S. firms over a four-year period. Our choice of firms is based on adequate liquidity and trading interest across different strike prices in the options market, ensuring economically meaningful RNS estimates. We also incorporate significant methodological enhancements. Consistent with earlier results, we find that the RNS of individual firms varies significantly and negatively with firm size, firm systematic risk, and market volatility; and significantly and positively with the RNS of the market index; and most of the variation in individual RNS is explained by firm-specific rather than market-wide factors. We also document several interesting new results that are clearly unambiguous and significantly stronger than in earlier work, or opposite to earlier evidence, or for variables that have been examined for the first time. First, we find that market sentiment has a negative and significant effect on RNS. Second, we find that higher a firm's own volatility, the more negative the RNS, a relationship that is in the same direction as for overall market volatility. Third, greater market liquidity is associated with more negative RNS, but the liquidity that is relevant for RNS is that of the options market, rather than that in the underlying stock. Surprisingly, volatility asymmetry is not relevant for RNS. Finally, the leverage ratio is not negatively but positively and strongly related with RNS.",

The impact of cross-border local bias on investors' bilateral foreign equity investments is economically significant and holds even after controlling for previously identified explanations of international asset allocation.",

We find that investors pursuing the first two investment strategies would realise significantly negative abnormal returns on average. In contrast, applying a bootstrapping procedure, we find that investing according to the latter two investment strategies does not yield significant underperformance. The difference in performance among investment strategies points to the phenomenon that firms going public in hot IPO markets perform worse than those going public in cold markets. We analyse to what extent this phenomenon can be attributed to pseudo market timing. Based on simulations, our results indicate that pseudo market timing can partly explain the performance of IPO investment strategies between 1996 and 2002.",

We exploit salient distributional features of multivariate financial price processes to uniquely determine these contributions. Thereby we resolve the main drawback of the widely used Hasbrouck (1995) methodology which merely delivers upper and lower bounds of a market's information share. When these bounds diverge, as is the case in many applications, informational leadership becomes blurred. We show how fat tails and tail dependence of price changes, which emerge as a result of differences in market design and liquidity, can be exploited to estimate unique information shares. The empirical application of the new methodology emphasizes the leading role of the credit derivatives market compared to the corporate bond market in pricing credit risk during the pre-crisis period.",

Surprisingly, however, we observe from the transcripts of 338 CEO speeches of German corporates between 2008 and 2016 that their sentiment is significantly related to abnormal stock returns and trading volumes following the AGM. Using a novel business-specific German dictionary based on Loughran and McDonald (2011), we find a negative association of the post-AGM returns with the speeches - negativity and a positive association with the speeches - relative positivity (i.e. positivity relative to negativity). Relative positivity moreover corresponds with a lower trading volume in a short time window surrounding the AGM.

        "abstract": "Technical trading strategies assume that past changes in prices help predict future changes. This makes sense if the past price trend reflects fundamental information that has not yet been fully incorporated in the current price. However, if the past price trend only reflects temporary pricing pressures, the technical trading strategy is doomed to fail. We demonstrate that this failure can be avoided by using financial statements as additional sources of information. We implement a trading strategy that invests in stocks with high past returns and high operating cash flows. This combination strategy yields a 3-factor alpha of 15% per year, which is much higher than that of the pure momentum strategy that invests in stocks with high past returns without considering operating cash flows. The combination strategy outperforms the momentum strategy in almost all years. The outperformance can be traced back to a higher probability of picking outperforming stocks. These are stocks that yield high future cash flows and hardly ever delist due to poor performance. The combination strategy is easily implemented: the information used is publicly available, the stocks chosen are liquid, and even high transaction costs do not erode the outperformance.",

        "abstract": "The main purpose in our scientific approach is the analysis of the evolution of the share price of Romanian companies listed on the Bucharest Stock Exchange in 2007-2013, and how this reacts to the registered profit. The forecast evaluation details for adjusted sample 2008- 2013 indicated that the Bias and Variance Proportions are small, which implies that the error of prediction is concentrated in covariance proportion and shows that the forecast is quite \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093acceptable\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac .

Finally the comparison between real data and the forecast outlined the fact that the PriceF reacts abnormally. Therefore analysis shows that if Profit increases, the stock price falls (i.e. Criterion 4 - PriceF&Profit) in almost 48% cases, compared with the real situation of about 24% cases (i.e. Criterion 4 - Price&Profit). In conclusion, even if we managed to translate the low prices of financial-economic crisis period into \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093normal capital market time\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac , using the model, one may notice that in 2009-2013 the cases number of shares that recorded higher prices grow up to 113 instead of 77 (i.e. Appendix C). Yet if we look at the evolution of Price&Profit / PriceF&Profit tandem we note that the profit recorded by the company is not a strength factor for the dynamic average share price of the Romanian listed companies.",

The extent to which investors take into consideration the investment recommendations made by the analysts differs mainly due to the degree of the capital market development, the role it plays in financial intermediation process and the informational efficiency of the market. Based on the data collected on the Bloomberg platform, we analyzed to what extent the stock exchange evolution trend (increase or decrease) overlaps the trend forecasted by the analysts. Thus, we test whether the increase/decrease estimated by the analysts matched the stock exchange evolution in the following quarter of the recommendation announcement, without highlighting the level of the recorded increase/decrease. Also, we compared the estimated potential upside/downside against the percentage change of the average price in the quarter following the recommendation announcement compared with the price recorded on the day of recommendation.",

We use a unique data set containing monthly returns of 949 UK equity mutual funds over a 28-year period to measure fund performance. We find that idiosyncratic risk cannot be eliminated in UK mutual funds. We show that idiosyncratic risk is negatively related to returns for all funds investment style categories. We present evidence that the inclusion of idiosyncratic risk significantly increases the number of funds showing statistically significant and positive selectivity skills (alpha). Furthermore, all equity mutual funds turn to show significant volatility timing performance when idiosyncratic risk is considered. Finally, we find that idiosyncratic risk can forecast fund returns after controlling for macroeconomic variables.",

To accomplish this objective both parametric and non-parametric event-study tests are conducted using the data collected from 827 notifications published on the Zagreb Stock Exchange website. After filtering the notifications for overlapping events, there were 48 insiders\u00e2\u0080\u0099 purchase events and 50 insiders\u00e2\u0080\u0099 sales events. The results indicate that insiders can earn abnormal returns on share purchases based on their insider knowledge and that the information on insider purchases can bring additional information to outside investors. However, in the case of notifications of share sales by insiders, Cumulative Average Abnormal Returns (CAARs) after the event are not statistically significant and are just slightly positive, thus bringing no abnormal returns for insiders and not conveying information to the public. This suggests that the market may perceive sales having a lower informational content, as motivation for sales may be other needs, such as liquidity.",

The purpose of this study is to determine the observable factors that affect valuation in the AIM. We apply OLS, LASSO regression, and Extreme Bounds Analysis (EBA) techniques on historical accounting data to test our theory of valuation. The statistical sample consists of 2,185 IPOs issued on the AIM between 1995 and 2020. Our findings suggest that the market valuation of IPOs in the AIM is systematically related to a multiplicity of factors. These include earnings per share (EPS) in the after-market, operating cash follow per share, and the percentage of shares issued to the public. The findings of the study have a practical value for investors who are interested in buying IPOs in the AIM.",

From the methodological point of view, the main innovation lies in disentangling 'good' macroeconomics news from 'bad' news, and, simultaneously, considering time intervals with and without confounding announcements from other sources. Releases from both institutes lead to an immediate response of returns occurring 15 seconds after the announcements, i.e. within the first possible time interval. Announcements of both institutes are also clearly and immediately reflected in the volatility, which remains at a significantly higher level for approximately two minutes slightly elevated for approximately 15 minutes. Combining returns and volatility in a GARCH(1,1)-model, the paper reveals that significant increases in volatility only show up in the presence of simultaneous news released by other sources, whereas return reactions can be observed irrespective of whether confounding announcements are published or not.",

Investigating an index series measured at the Frankfurt stock exchange the paper compares estimation results of parametric and nonparametric autoregressive models with respect to possible weekday dependence of return data. Allowing for heteroskedastic error distributions the wild bootstrap is used to infer against time varying means and correlation of return data in parametric models and to obtain confidence bands for nonparametric estimates. It is shown that time dependence is an important feature describing the dynamics of German stock market returns in the period 1960-79.

Using a comprehensive set of liquidity measures obtained from a detailed, quote-level dataset of the largest interdealer market for Italian government bonds, we show that changes in credit risk, as measured by the Italian sovereign credit default swap (CDS) spread, generally drive the liquidity of the market: a 10% change in the CDS spread leads a 11% change in the bid-ask spread. This relationship is stronger, and the transmission is faster, when the CDS spread is above the 500 basis point threshold, estimated endogenously, and can be ascribed to changes in margins and collateral, as well as clientele effects. Moreover, we show that the Long-Term Refinancing Operations (LTRO) intervention by the ECB weakened the sensitivity of the liquidity provision by the market makers to changes in the Italian government's credit risk. We also document the importance of market-wide and dealer-specific funding liquidity measures in determining the market liquidity for Italian government bonds.",

Although these results match nicely with common notions of liquidity, one key element is missing: liquidity also depends on (3) an asset s correlation with other securities. For example, if an illiquid asset is highly correlated with a liquid asset, then speculators will naturally step in and make it liquid . In this paper, we update Garbade and Silber s model to include an infinitely liquid market security. We show that when the market security is added, the liquidity of the non-market asset is still a decreasing function of volatility and an increasing function of investor participation, but it is now also an increasing function of its correlation with the market. Furthermore, we show that at a critical correlation value of 0.86, it is optimal for the asset to continuously clear, i.e., for orders to transact immediately when placed in the market. This low-latency result holds regardless of the other properties of the asset. The updated model can help answer several questions relevant to current financial markets: How and why do short-term speculators provide liquidity in markets? , How much benefit do these speculators add? , and Can extremely low-latency in markets be beneficial?",

We show that they are very much interrelated, and we explore the relationships in detail. Among other things, we show that: (1) Volatility dependence produces sign dependence, so long as expected returns are nonzero. Hence one should expect sign dependence, given the overwhelming evidence of volatility dependence. (2) The standard finding of little or no conditional mean dependence is entirely consistent with a significant degree of sign dependence and volatility dependence. In particular, sign dependence does not imply market inefficiency. (3) Sign dependence is not likely to be found via analysis of sign autocorrelations, because the nature of sign dependence is highly nonlinear.

        "abstract": "In recent years there has been a tremendous growth in the influx of news related to traded assets in international financial markets. This financial news is now available via print media but also through real-time online sources such as internet news and social media sources. The increase in the availability of financial news and investor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ease of access to it has a potentially significant impact on market price formation as these news items are swiftly transformed into investors sentiment which in turn drives prices. Various commercial agencies have started developing their own financial news data sets which are used by investors and traders to support their algorithmic trading strategies. Thomson Reuters News Analytics (TRNA)1 is one such data set. In this study we use the TRNA data set to construct a series of daily sentiment scores for Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) stock index component companies. We use these daily DJIA market sentiment scores to study the influence of financial news sentiment scores on the stock prices of these companies using a multi-factor model. We use an augmented Fama French Three Factor Model to evaluate the additional effects of financial news sentiment on stock prices in the context of this model. Our results suggest that even when market factors are taken into account, sentiment scores have a significant effect on Dow Jones constituent company returns and that lagged daily sentiment scores are often significant, suggesting that information compounded in these scores is not immediately reflected in security prices and related return series.",

Therefore, the present study examines factors affecting NFT returns, from market-related factors (crypto-market index return and stock market index return) to the Amihud illiquidity ratio and Google search trends during different market conditions. The wavelet coherences-based methodology was applied separately during the boom, bust, normal, and turbulent periods identified by structural breakpoints. Based on 14 NFT projects between April 2019 and July 2022, results show two fundamental asymmetries influencing these NFT returns. First, there is an asymmetry in the behavior of the factors in different periods; second, there is an asymmetry in how illiquidity manifests itself over NFTs that do or do not possess cash flow-generating potential.",

        "abstract": "Abstract The effect of investor sentiment on stock volatility is a highly attractive research question in both the academic field and the real financial industry. With the proposal of China's \"dual carbon\" target, green stocks have gradually become an essential branch of Chinese stock markets. Focusing on 106 stocks from the new energy, environmental protection, and carbon\u00e2\u0080\u0093neutral sectors, we construct two investor sentiment proxies using Internet text and stock trading data, respectively. The Internet sentiment is based on posts from Eastmoney Guba, and the trading sentiment comes from a variety of trading indicators. In addition, we divide the realized volatility into continuous and jump parts, and then investigate the effects of investor sentiment on different types of volatilities. Our empirical findings show that both sentiment indices impose significant positive impacts on realized, continuous, and jump volatilities, where trading sentiment is the main factor. We further explore the mediating effect of information asymmetry, measured by the volume-synchronized probability of informed trading (VPIN), on the path of investor sentiment affecting stock volatility. It is evidenced that investor sentiments are positively correlated with the VPIN, and they can affect volatilities through the VPIN. We then divide the total sample around the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The empirical results reveal that the market volatility after the COVID-19 pandemic is more susceptible to investor sentiments, especially to Internet sentiment. Our study is of great significance for maintaining the stability of green stock markets and reducing market volatility.",

Using the cross-quantilogram method and quantile connectedness approach, we identify cross-quantile interdependence between the analyzed variables. Our results show that the spillover between cryptocurrencies and volatility indices for the major traditional markets varies substantially across quantiles, implying that diversification benefits for these assets may differ widely across normal and extreme market conditions. Under normal market conditions, the total connectedness index is moderate and falls below the elevated values observed under bearish and bullish market conditions. Moreover, we show that under all market conditions, cryptocurrencies have a leadership influence over the volatility indices. Our results have important policy implications for enhancing financial stability and deliver valuable insights for deploying volatility-based financial instruments that can potentially provide cryptocurrency investors with suitable hedges, as we show that cryptocurrency and volatility markets are insignificantly (weakly) connected under normal (extreme) market conditions.",

However, large stocks exhibit intra-industry reversals, in which industry winners underperform industry losers in the subsequent month, when controlling for price momentum. Conversely, once this intra-industry reversal is neutralised, large stocks display momentum behaviour, in which market winners outperform market losers. These conditional strategies generate positive, significant risk-adjusted returns on large stocks in Australia. This paper documents significant industry momentum, as winning industries outperform losing industries in the following month. This industry momentum effect dominates the intra-industry reversal. The paper also finds evidence that conditional reversals are driven by illiquidity and are inhibited by stock prices under-reacting to earnings announcements.",

Some of them experienced various types of changes, including passing from the classical form to an extended one, with an enlarged specific time interval. This paper approaches the Holiday Effect extended form on the United States capital market. In its classical form, the Holiday Effect refers to abnormal stock returns on a trading day before a public holiday and a trading day after. We study the behavior of stocks returns for a time interval that starts four trading days before a public holiday and it ends four trading days after. In this investigation we employ the daily closing values of four important indexes from the United States capital market: Dow Jones Industrial Average, Standard & Poor's 500, Russell 2000 and NASDAQ Composite. In order to capture the changes experienced in time by the Extended Holiday Effect we analyze the returns of these indexes for three periods: January 1990 - December 1999, January 2000 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 December 2009 and January 2010 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 April 2020. The investigation revealed, for some trading days from the enlarged specific time interval, returns that were, in average, significant larger or smaller than those of the days outside of this interval. We found especially high abnormal returns on four or three trading days before public holidays and low abnormal returns on one or two trading days after public holidays. The results also suggest that the Extended Holiday Effect was more visible in relative quiet periods than in the turbulent ones and it influences especially the stock returns of small cap companies.",

        "abstract": "An efficient market should not show any anomalies. When new information reaches a market which is efficient, it should automatically translate into prices of assets, which ought to eliminate the possibility of gaining an advantage over other investors, thus preventing excess profits. However, studies on capital markets indicate that in reality it is possible to earn unusually high profits by taking advantage of certain anomalies which occur on a given market. Among such anomalies there is the momentum effect. This study performed on the Stock Exchange in Warsaw has shown that the momentum effect occurred throughout the entire analyzed time period. Positive returns demonstrated for investment strategies based on the momentum effect were unexplainable by the classical theory of finances. A correlation was found between the economic situation on the stock exchange and portfolio return rates, but it was too weak to attribute the effect to a single decisive factor. In addition, the returns from investments based on the momentum effect were statistically higher in January than in the other months, which was caused by the January effect, stimulating the occurrence of statistically higher returns at the beginning of a year rather than later on during the analyzed period of time. Research in this field carried out in other countries justifies the claim that there are many irrational factors which together create the momentum effect on the stock exchange. Thus, it is possible to conclude that irrational decisions may have strong impact on the pricing of stocks on the capital market. The momentum effect persisted throughout the entire analyzed period, although its power changed cyclically, which coincides with results of research carried out in other countries. The fact that the momentum effect did not disappear may suggest that the factors involved in its creation are an indispensable part of the market, and this seems to undermine the commonly accepted hypothesis about the efficiency of capital markets.",

        "abstract": "Abstract We study in detail and explicitly solve the version of Kyle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s model introduced in a specific case in Back and Baruch (Econometrica 72:433\u00e2\u0080\u0093465, 2004), where the trading horizon is given by an exponentially distributed random time. The first part of the paper is devoted to the analysis of time-homogeneous equilibria using tools from the theory of one-dimensional diffusions. It turns out that such an equilibrium is only possible if the final payoff is Bernoulli distributed as in Back and Baruch (Econometrica 72:433\u00e2\u0080\u0093465, 2004). We show in the second part that the signal the market makers use in the general case is a time-changed version of the one they would have used had the final payoff had a Bernoulli distribution. In both cases, we characterise explicitly the equilibrium price process and the optimal strategy of the informed trader. In contrast to the original Kyle model, it is found that the reciprocal of the market\u00e2\u0080\u0099s depth, i.e., Kyle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lambda, is a uniformly integrable supermartingale. While Kyle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lambda is a potential, i.e., converges to 0, for the Bernoulli-distributed final payoff, its limit in general is different from 0.",

        "abstract": "Abstract We studied the strategies exploiting the post-earnings announcement drift, the momentum, and the long-term return reversal in the Saudi stock market and their explanations. Using individual data for all the listed firms over the period 2010\u00e2\u0080\u00932019, we found that these strategies are significantly profitable regardless of the formation and holding period length, and their profitability generally persists for the subperiods. Two controversial explanations for this profitability were examined using a time series approach: the risk-based rational explanation and the under- and overreaction-based behavioral explanation. We found that the profitability of the three strategies persists after controlling for risk using the Capital Asset Pricing Model, the Fama\u00e2\u0080\u0093French three-factor model, and the Fama\u00e2\u0080\u0093French five-factor model, which rejects the risk hypothesis. To examine the behavioral explanation, we extended the Fama\u00e2\u0080\u0093French five-factor model to include a factor reflecting the underreaction or the overreaction to quarterly earnings announcement based on unexpected earnings. Our findings indicate that the momentum can be explained by the market underreaction to firms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 earnings announcement, while the long-term return reversal cannot be explained by the overreaction to a series of similar information conveyed by earnings announcement events.",

This paper investigates the relation between frequency of mobile Internet messages and subsequent stock returns. We find that firms with higher proportion of mobile Internet messages on average earn a significant return premium even after controlling for well-known risk factors. Moreover, the marginal effect of mobile Internet messages is more pronounced among stocks in weaker information environments (i.e., higher fraction of individual ownership and lower analysts following). Further results suggest this correlation is more likely to be driven by \u00e2\u0080\u009cnoise\u00e2\u0080\u009d rather than \u00e2\u0080\u009cinformation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d We also provide evidence that the lack of liquidity can explain the persistence of the correlation between mobile Internet messages and stock returns.

Ordinary Least Square regression with autoregressive term, GARCH (1, 1), TGARCH (1, 1) and EGARCH (1, 1) were used. There is no evidence of day-of-the-week effect in GSE but there exists Friday effect in NSE. Daily returns could be predicted in NSE but cannot be predicted in the GSE using past prices and returns information. The GARCH model suggests a high degree of persistent in the conditional volatility of daily stock returns in NSE. The TGARCH and EARCH models show no evidence of asymmetry in daily returns in NSE. However, there was no evidence of conditional volatility for GSE-CI. The two markets are inefficient and whiles day of the week effects are irrelevant in making investment decisions in GSE it is relevant in NSE.

Using the press conference on March 13, 2020, we examine the effect on the trading volatility and returns for each of the eight companies represented. We find positive abnormal returns for the companies participating in the press conference. Using the Robintrack data aggregated from the Robinhood retail trading platform and intraday TAQ data, we see that both retail and institutional trading volume increased on the press conference day. However, the increase in retail trading approximately doubled the increase in institutional trading. For the two companies with the lowest Robinhood user ownership prior to the press conference, ownership more than doubled within an hour of the press conference. Panel VAR analysis including control firms shows the press conference resulted in significant intraday returns, volume, and buy-order imbalances in participating firms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 stock.",

But the extent to which this applies to stock markets is still in dispute. While early evidence points to a Monday effect leading to negative returns, recent studies tend to suggest its disappearance or reversal. As a replication study, this paper searches for new evidence of this effect in the German stock market. We use data on the German blue-chip index DAX between 2000 and 2017 to test for the presence of a Monday effect by applying regression and controlling with GARCH analysis. The observation period provides a detailed insight into different market phases in one of the most liquid and information-efficient international stock markets.

The sample consists of daily data for the period from January 1, 2009 to October 20, 2015. Stationarity and Cointegration test results reveal that spot and futures prices are integrated and cointegrated for all commodities. The price discovery results show that the futures market leads the spot market in case of six commodities, i.e., castor seed, coriander, cottonseed oilcake, soy oil, sugarM and turmeric. Whereas, in the case of four commodities (chana (chickpea), guar seed, jeera, and mustard seed), price discovery takes place in the spot market. Therefore, it could be inferred that futures market is more efficient in price discovery of agricultural commodities. Policymakers could use these results to design futures contracts on other commodities or to plan concrete policies to curb speculation without hampering the efficiency of the agricultural commodity derivatives market.",

Despite the fact that previous studies have demonstrated the persistence of institutional trading can be short-term positively correlated with following stock returns, some empirical studies show that this short-term positive relation holds only under particular circumstances. Recently, Dasgupta et al. (J Finance 66:635\u00e2\u0080\u0093653, 2011) have even found that the persistence of institutional trading is associated with reversals in stock returns. To fill the gap in the literature, I use a unique monthly institutional ownership data to present new empirical evidence showing that institutional trading not only has a short-term positive impact on stock returns but can also have a long-term negative effect. Moreover, I find that stocks with the lower accumulated growth of institutional ownership tend to have greater momentum than stocks with higher such growth. A zero-investment strategy of buying stocks with \u00e2\u0080\u0098LOW\u00e2\u0080\u0099-decile institutional ownership and selling \u00e2\u0080\u0098HIGH\u00e2\u0080\u0099-decile ones can outperform the market and generate significant abnormal returns.",

Results show that the CHF and JPY are traditionally more sensitive to macroeconomic surprises than other currencies, reflecting the fact that macroeconomic surprises impact uncertainty and risk aversion. This link was further magnified during the crisis and could not be broken by the specific measures adopted by monetary authorities to limit the appreciation trend. We also find some evidence that, during the crisis, CHF and JPY responded more strongly to surprises generating an appreciation than to surprises leading to a depreciation. Additionally, both currencies also systematically respond to changes in the general market environment.

Empirically however, this prediction can often be refuted due to liquidity and trading cost aspects. Using a unique high-frequency data set, this paper studies the price formation of the German equity index market, the DAX, in a multivariate framework and breaks it down into its four main market segments. For the period under consideration from July 2007 to December 2009, which is characterized by severe financial turmoil, I find that the futures market leads in terms of price discovery, closely followed by the exchange-traded fund. Further, the time series behavior of the information share measures clearly suggests a sensitivity towards the market environment. I show that the informational contribution to price discovery is affected by the financial crisis and that short-selling constraints weaken the price discovery role of certain markets.",

        "abstract": "Abstract This paper revisits the B-shares discount puzzle for dual-class shares in China. The major finding shows that the Shanghai stock market experiences a greater downward correction in stock prices and the discount rate of B-shares diminishes after the B-shares\u00e2\u0080\u0099 opening, but, in the long run the price discounts of B-shares persist. The stock returns of dual-class firms in both Shanghai and Shenzhen B-share markets have negative abnormal returns during the opening event, and then reverse into positive ones markedly in the long run. The investors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 trading activities are sensitive to the number of board members and state-ownership structures. In addition, the return spillover from the sample B-share to the A-share index obviously accelerates and the impact persistence is shortened.",

Later on, we use the predicted values to generate a trading rule and we check the possibility of obtaining extraordinary profits in the Foreign Exchange Market. Our results reveal a slight forecasting ability for one-period-ahead which is lost when more periods ahead are considered. On the other hand, our trading strategy obtains above-normal profits.

        "abstract": "The research on financial engineering by means of genetic programming is gradually popular and appealing. For example, Kaboudan (1999, 2001) and Iba and Sasaki (1999), Iba and Sasaki (1999), used standard GP to evolve forecasting models. Neely, et al. (1997), Allen and Karjalainen (1999), Fyfe et al. (1999), and Neely and Weller (1999) applied standard GP to evolving trading strategies. In Wang (2000), automated defined functions (ADFs) are further included to search useful trading strategies. Iba and Nikolaev (2000) employed an enhanced GP system, STROGANOFF (Iba et al.,1994), which searches for polynomial autoregressive models to the stock price prediction. In addition, Nikolaev and Iba (2001) developed polynomial harmonic GP which outperforms the previous GP system, STROGANOFF. In the research of financial engineering, besides the determination of important explanatory variables, there are two important factors which influence our understanding about the regularity of the time series data. The first one is the inherent complexity of data series. The second one concerns how we explain the regularity, i.e., representation. In Kaboudan (1995, 1998), he gave a complexity measure (theta) for a time series data. The work of Iba and Nikolaev (2000) has implicitly pointed out the importance of representation in GP. In this paper, we try to figure out the relationship between the complexity of time series data and GP's representation",

        "abstract": "Motivated from the charting analysis in the financial industry, Chen and He (2003) are the first to use self-organizing maps to search for and identify price patterns. Such a model is referred to as the trajectory-domain model (TDM). Chen and Tsao (2003) apply the TDMs to three American stock indices, including the Dow Jones, Nasdaq, and S&P 500. It is found that there is some evidence to support the relevance of the TDM to informative pattern discovery. Some patterns discovered by the TDMs can in effect transmit signals of abnormal returns. In this study, we examine a number of interesting questions for the application of the TDM. First, while the TDM seems to be successful in the stock markets, we ask whether the TDM can still discover informative patterns in the foreign exchange markets. In particular, we consider four foreign exchange rates, including TWD/USD, GBP/USD, JPY/USD, and HKD/USD. Second, Neely and Weller (1999) apply the trading rules discovered from DEM/USD to the European Monetary System and conclude that the rules perform well for some of the currencies. This finding seems to suggest that the profitable trading rules discovered from one market could be transferred to one another market. The question we are interested here is to see if the similar results exist when the trading rule is based on the geometric patterns, in particular, the patterns discovered by TDM.",

        "abstract": "\\tTraders in this model of an asset market have the opportunity to conduct individual research to acquire a noisy signal of a security's future value, or they can employ least-squares learning in an attempt at extracting the private information of other traders through observing the price. For a fixed proportion of the traders using fundamental research, n, the model converges to a stable fixed point equilibrium. At the fixed point, the regression traders outperform the fundamental traders for all values of n > 0. The equilibrium suffers from a Grossman and Stiglitz (1980) type paradox of efficient markets. Endogenize n based on performance and the Grossman-Stiglitz paradox is alleviated. The model is characterized by an unstable fixed point. As the model converges towards the fixed point, the regression traders perform well. As n falls, the regression traders begin to have a substantial impact on the price, causing greater fluctuations in profits and in n. Inevitably, the actual n is significantly different than the value of n implicit in the regression traders' coefficient values, introducing error in the regression trader's forecast. This leads to substantial mispricing that results in losses to the regression traders. It also throws the model far from the fixed point, starting the convergence process over.",

But the Behavioural Finance discipline has challenged the assumptions of Efficient Market Hypothesis, particularly the investor rationality concept. It has incorporated emotion and psychology too into investment behaviour study. The January effect -or the abnormally large returns on common stocks in most months of January- has been one of the most intriguing issues in financial economics. Behavioral finance attempts to give some explanations about these anomalies as psychological and emotional factors involved in the stock market and that affect the behavior of investors and the market efficiency. In this article, January effect known as market anomalies is tested by power ratio method which is developed by Gu (2003). Monthly logarithmic returns of years 2009- 2016 for XU100, XUHIZ, XUMAL, XUSIN ve XUTEK Indexes are used in the analysis. Consequently, except one, existence of January effect is found at five of four indexes in Turkey stock market.",

The results reveal that R2 is inversely related to the firm value. This is consistent with the model of Dow and Gorton (1997). Moreover, we found that companies with high R2 have significantly higher returns than those with low R2, over a two year period time, which is inconsistent with the findings of Stowe and Xing (2011).

However, in these studies, mood was not measured directly but rather speculated upon or inferred. This paper suggests capturing investors? moods by dividing the information contained in the VIX, popularly called the fear index, into two components: that which is correlated with volatility forecasts and information that is not. By doing so, we provide further evidence about the relationship between investor mood and risk aversion around joyful occasions (holidays) as well as for other occasions that may result in negative moods (the disruption of sleep resulting from the move to and from daylight savings time). We find that the actual values of the VIX and its cousin, the VXO, tend to be lower than their expected values in the case of joyful holidays, reflecting a more optimistic mood among investors, while during daylight savings time weekends, the actual values of the VIX and VXO tend to be higher than their theoretical values.

The extent of the presidential party?s control over the Congress does not affect our main result. The result is driven by small firms, who typically do not have financial resources to hedge away political risks, and by the firms located in the states where residents more strongly support the president.

        "abstract": "This paper attempts to examine herding behavior in the Russian stock market by implementing four different methods designed to test for herding by Chang et al. (2000), Christie&Huang (1995), Hwang&Salmon (2001) and Torrecillas et al (2016). The main goal is to investigate the implications of the interest rate and foreign exchange fluctuations for the stock market efficiency. The results of the work help to identify the sources of herding behavior in the Russian stock market.Employing different approaches towards measuring herding, it is possible to determine whether individuals copy each other?s actions (Torrecillas et al (2016)) or herd towards market views about market index (Chang et al. (2000), Christie&Huang (1995), Hwang&Salmon (2001)). This paper starts by the establishing the transition from efficient-market behavior to herding behavior by using Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (Torrecillas et al (2016)) applied to MICEX closing prices within the period from September 1997 to December 2017. The DFA reveals the presence of persistent herding behavior during the 2007-2009 crisis. Next, Christie and Huang?s CSSD measure of stock returns is used to capture if herding related to the firm-specific risk in the portfolio is present at the market. Consistent with results of the previous studies, the method fails to establish traces of herding. Christie and Huang?s improved measure of CSSD with non-linear trend by Chang et al. (2000) yields evidence of herding in the down market during monetary policy announcements. The results of the Hwang and Salmon?s state space models help to demonstrate herding related to the market risk by analyzing relative dispersion of the time-varying betas for assets. The main finding is that changes in the betas can?t be explained by movements in fundamentals, which indicates intentional herding. Therefore, bad news for the stock market (interest rate increase and currency depreciation) induce intentional herding in the Russian stock market. Intentional herding during market stress has important implications for portfolio diversification for both diversified and undiversified investors.",

Focusing on the post Campbell and Shiller period, our findings suggest that the anomaly is not only attributed to term premia, but also relates to expectation errors. We found that macroeconomic surprises and irrationality from investors? behavior are important determinants of expectation errors. These factors are capable of explaining the rejection of the expectation hypothesis and the US term structure anomaly in long-term securities.",

        "abstract": "Behavioral finance is a field that has grown toward the end of 20th century as a reaction to the efficient market hypothesis. This new field studies the effect of investor psychology on financial decisions and explains stock market anomalies in financial markets. Herding is such an anomaly that is defined as mimicking others? decisions or market trend. The aim of the study is to detect whether there is herding or not in Borsa Istanbul. To test the existence of herding, stock returns traded on Borsa Istanbul and BIST 100 Index as market indicator are used. Data covers daily returns from 1988 to 2014 and intraday returns from 1995 to 2014. Firstly, herding is analyzed based on the methodology of cross-sectional dispersion of the stocks developed by Christie and Huang (1995) and Chang, Cheng and Khorana (2000). The results indicate that there is no herding for both up and down markets for daily and intraday intervals in Borsa Istanbul. However, tendency of herding is higher in up markets. To enhance and compare the results, the methodology based on the cross-sectional volatility of beta coefficients suggested by Hwang and Salmon (2004) is used. This methodology has provided evidence of herding in Borsa Istanbul. It is also observed that investors follow the market trend more in session two markets rather than session one markets. Thus, it is concluded that investors imitate the others more under normal market conditions rather than noisy market conditions. These results are consistent with the assumptions of Hwang and Salmon (2004).",

We also compare the performance of actively managed funds to passively managed funds instead of comparing them to a theoretical index. For a sample of 160 funds with 13\u00e2\u0080\u0099672 monthly observations we find that active as well as passive funds significantly underperform indices on an aggregated basis. However, active large-cap funds significantly underperform and active Small-&Mid-Cap-funds significantly outperform the index. Further, we find that the average manager of an active Swiss equity fund systematically overweights small-cap, value, and low-momentum stocks. When directly comparing active to passive funds, active funds significantly underperform by -1.1% p.a. on average. While active institutional funds can almost keep up with the performance of passive funds, active retail funds cannot and drive the substantial underperformance observed for active funds. Finally, active funds perform better before the millennium than thereafter. This robust result supports the hypothesis of ongoing efficiency increases in the Swiss stock market.",

        "abstract": "Purpose: The main objective of this study is to obtain new empirical evidence on non-synchronous trading effects through modelling the predictability of market indices. Design / Methodology / Approach: We test for lead-lag effects between the Indian Nifty and Nifty Junior indices using Pesaran-Timmermann tests and Granger-Causality. We then propose a simple test on overnight returns, in order to infer whether the observed predictability is mainly attributable to non-synchronous trading or some form of inefficiency. Findings: The evidence suggests that non-synchronous trading is a better explanation for the observed predictability in the Indian stock market. Research limitations / implications: The indication that non-synchronous trading effects become more pronounced in high-frequency data, suggests that prior studies using daily data may underestimate the impacts of non-synchronicity. Originality / value: The originality of the paper rests on various important contributions: (a) we look at overnight returns to infer whether predictability is more attributable to non-synchronous trading or to some form of inefficiency, (b) we investigate the impacts of non-synchronicity in terms of lead-lag effects rather than serial correlation, and (c) we use high-frequency data which gauges the impacts of non-synchronicity during less active parts of the trading day.",

In almost all studies, researchers analyze the IPO performance using the dataset from highly liquid markets. However, the pricing behavior of IPOs in the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) is different. There is a reason to expect the price performance of IPOs in the AIM to be significantly different from IPO performance in traditional markets mainly because of the diminished liquidity of AIM offerings as well as the meager disclosures required in comparison to traditional markets. To test our propositions, we select 292 IPOs listed on AIM during the period between 2001 and 2016 and apply the Extreme Bound Analysis (EBA) to determine the factors that cause longer-term performance. This study reports that investors in the alternative markets earn significant positive returns if the stock is held for three years, and the price variation is dependent upon the firm size. This illustrates that investment in small-sized firms seems more profitable as compared to those of large-sized firms in the AIM. Moreover, this study examines statistical evidence bearing on the question of whether early investors in IPOs can expect abnormal excess returns in the long-run.",

For this purpose, we estimated the daily measures of probability of informed trading (PIN) and symmetric-order flow shock (PSOS) 32 Tehran Stock Exchange (TSE) stocks belonging to 11 industries of TSE during the period from 2015 to 2018. PIN is an indicator of asymmetric information risk and PSOS indicating diverse opinions among investors whose variations and intensity play an important role in price formation and stock liquidity. Results indicate that the minimum and maximum values of PIN and PSOS indices are significantly different from their annual and four-year average. Accordingly, information risk varies remarkably along time and there is a substantial need to use dynamic models to study this risk. In most stocks that have higher market value experience less risks of asymmetric information and diverse opinions shocks than other stocks. Entirely, it appears that the average and the maximum of information risk and diverse opinions shocks at TSE are higher than in developed markets. Also, exchange rate shock in 2018 in Iran considerably increased diverse opinions on petrochemical and metal industries.",

We choose Black and Scholes (BS) implied volatility as our model-based volatility and VIX as our measure of MFIV. By using non-overlapping monthly samples from January 2004 to June 2019, we find that both BS implied volatility and MFIV are informationally efficient and subsume information contained in the historical realized volatility for forecasting future volatility. This is the first study show that BS implied volatility and MFIV contain the same information and there is no winner for forecasting future volatility. This implied that a forecast model could include both BS implied volatility and MFIV",

The main conclusion is that profitability of moving average strategies is not constant over time and that is mainly due to linear and nonlinear episodic dependencies. The trading rule profits did not declined over time in the case of the Romanian currency market. Exploring the causes of profitability, it was found that it was closely related to the intensity of manifestation of episodic linear and nonlinear dependencies, the state of the market, and it was not the result of a time varying risk premium. The empirical results are consistent with the Adaptive Markets Hypothesis (Lo, 2004), but not with the Efficient Market Hypothesis.",

It is a puzzle for the researchers whether CDS spreads are following a random walk process or not.

The rescaled range analysis is used for each country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s data with four different frequencies. The results show that there is a persistency in all CDS spreads.

His article concluded that GNMA futures were more effective than T-Bill futures in reducing price change risk. Moreover, in the short term, the performance of T-Bill futures in reducing risk was extremely poor. The purpose of this article is to determine whether these results are due to a misspecification of the model and to test whether the hedging effectiveness of the T-Bill futures market has changed after three years of trading. A portfolio model of hedging effectiveness is formulated to account for the constant yield price accumulation over time on Treasury bills as distinguished from price changes due to instantaneous changes in yield. We test the T-Bill futures market using the portfolio model and conclude that the market provides very good opportunities for hedging, provided that the spot position is comprised of Treasury bills deliverable against the futures contract.",

The second is where each one seeking to maximize his utility function is intuitively constrained to minimize the risk. The means that can combine these two aims is a well-defined investment process.

Employing an event study methodology, we first calculate the abnormal returns of all listed Vietnamese firms around the CPTPP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s approval date. Then, we attempt to link these abnormal returns to firms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 characteristics. We find evidence that the announcement of the CPTPP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s approval is associated with positive abnormal returns for Vietnam\u00e2\u0080\u0099s listed firms. We also find considerable heterogeneity in the magnitude and pace of the impacts of the CPTPP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s approval on market returns across Vietnam\u00e2\u0080\u0099s two stock exchanges. However, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the market did not react to the CPTPP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s approval at the sectoral level.",

        "abstract": "According to Efficient Market Hypothesis, investors cannot gain abnormal returns. But various anomalies such as day or intra-day effect which are frequently observed at the stock markets provide some abnormal returns to investors. In the literature, many studies have found various anomalies for different national and international stock markets. But most of the applied studies used aggregate data in their econometric analysis. The question is whether the same anomalies exist in sub-indexes such as communication, technology, sports and services, etc. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether there are the same anomalies such as intra-day effect and day of the week effect for an aggregated index and 23 sub-indexes of Borsa Istanbul. The data which used in this study is daily and covers the period of 2005-2015 for Turkey. Findings show that there is evidence for intra-day effect in all 24 indexes and day of the week effect in 2 sub-indexes.",

For robustness check, we extend our analysis by combining exchange rates (indicative quotes v.s. transaction rate), frequency (transaction based time v.s. 1 minute through 1 day), and order flows (sign v.s. signed volume). The results show that order flow is an important variable for explaining the KRW/USD regardless of frequency and of choice of quotes. Based on Hasbrouck's measure we find that 14-28% of permanent exchange rate variation is due to private information. The magnitude is smaller than that of international currency presenting, for example, in Payne (2003). The discrepancy arises both from currency choice and from too short data span in Payne (2003).",

        "abstract": "This study quantifies the dynamic interrelationship between the KOSPI index return and search query data derived from the Naver DataLab. The empirical estimation using a bivariate GARCH model reveals that negative contemporaneous correlations between the stock return and the search frequency prevail during the sample period. Meanwhile, the search frequency has a negative association with the one-week- ahead stock return but not vice versa. In addition to identifying dynamic correlations, the paper also aims to serve as a test bed in which the existence of profitable trading strategies based on big data is explored. Specifically, the strategy interpreting the heightened investor attention as a negative signal for future returns appears to have been superior to the benchmark strategy in terms of the expected utility over wealth. This paper also demonstrates that the big data-based option trading strategy might be able to beat the market under certain conditions. These results highlight the possibility of big data as a potential source-which has been left largely untapped-for establishing profitable trading strategies as well as developing insights on stock market dynamics.",

The findings reveal that the VNMVN30 ETF has a small deviation in price. This deviation is persistent with low change level between one-minute intervals.

        "abstract": "In the past, it was believed that investors may generate abnormal returns (AR) for trading stocks by employing technical trading rules. However, since the COVID-19 pandemic broke out, stock markets around the world seem to suffer a serious impact. Therefore, whether investors can beat the markets by applying technical trading rules during the period of COVID-19 pandemic becomes an important issue for market participants. The purpose of this study is to examine the profitability of trading stocks with the use of technical trading rules under the COVID-19 pandemic. By trading the constituent stocks of DJ 30 and NASDAQ 100, we find that almost all of the trading rules employed in this study fail to beat the market during the COVID-19 pandemic period, which is different from the results in 2019. The revealed findings of this study may shed light on that investors should adopt technical trading with care when stock markets are seriously affected by black swan events like COVID-19.",

We perform an extensive empirical analysis on the S&P500 and the relative sectors, covering more than 10 years. In addition, we follow Long/Short strategies in building portfolios based on Beta and their components where we compare results against the benchmark.

        "abstract": "Although there is an extensive literature on the impact of volatility on asset returns correlation, investigating this in relation to broad asset selection and in perspective of different timelines has received less attention. In comparison to the previous papers, we use a much broader set of 35 selected asset classes and used rolling returns for five different periods ranging from 3 months to 5 years to calculate rolling correlations, which was used further for regression analysis between rolling correlation and volatility index (VIX). Results showed more impact of volatility on the mid-term horizon, such as 1 year, possibly meaning that for longer periods, structural economic factors impact correlation significantly, while for shorter periods, immediate market reactions to events and short-term fluctuations reduce the impact of the correlation. Autocorrelation of residuals suggests that correlation follows trends, which is evidenced more in longer periods. The study contributes to existing literature by comparing the volatility impact across a broad range of assets and multiple time horizons, revealing that correlation is sensitive to time horizons \u00e2\u0080\u0093 overall and in terms of responses to heightened volatility. Also, the impact of volatility is different over different time periods, with most impact for the mid-time horizon, such as 1 year.",

        "abstract": "The main purpose of this paper is to investigate the performance of initial public offerings (IPOs) in the emerging markets with particular focus on the markets of Balkan countries. The paper provides analysis of long and short performance of IPOs. In the Balkan emerging markets IPOs are relatively rarely used. Although all observed Balkan countries have gone through processes of transition from planned economies to market economies in the past 25 years, just a few state-owned companies have been privatized by use of IPOs. Due to this specific nature of the companies the analyzed sample of IPOs is comprised of state-owned and non-state-owned companies. The results are interpreted and expounded accordingly, taking into consideration the aforementioned conjunction. The findings indicate that company characteristics, signalling variables and financial variables have influence on the IPOs short and long term performance. The paper provides academia and policymakers with new revelations concerning the IPO processes in Balkan emerging economies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 capital markets.",

        "abstract": "The paper aims to determine the effect of split ratings on corporate bond yields. A Two-Sample t-Test was conducted for each risk category of bonds to assess the impact of split ratings. Using a sample of corporate bonds issued between January 2000 and May 2023, the study finds evidence that split-rated bonds exhibit higher yields. This suggests that investors demand greater compensation for the risk associated with split ratings, which stems from the informational opaqueness and uncertainty surrounding these instruments. The research also reveals that the magnitude of the difference between split ratings affects bond yields, with larger gaps leading to higher yields. The findings have significant implications for investors and issuers, emphasising the need to carefully evaluate split-rated bonds and consistent credit ratings. By enhancing our understanding of the relationship between split ratings and bond yields, this research promotes transparency and informed decision-making in the corporate bond market.",

From an investor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s point of view, the performance of funds is important. These, along with the risks, are what most often determine the choice of fund type and finally the specific fund. The performance of a fund is often determined by both the size of the fund and the application of the managers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 selectivity and market sense. Purpose The aim of this research is to investigate the impact of fund size on performance through the use of selectivity and market sense by managers. Dividing funds into size groups will allow the search for patterns in terms of managers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 use of market timing. Research methodology The research used a Treynor-Mazuy model as a market timing model and Ward\u00e2\u0080\u0099s method as the cluster analysis methods. The performance of the funds was determined using an investment performance indicator, i.e., Omega. Results The obtained results indicate that the funds are similar within the groups. However, there were differences in the results between the groups. During periods of high volatility, it is recommended to invest in units of funds with an average size below the median. Novelty The added value is the study of market timing in groups of funds similar in size. In each group, the results of the Treynor-Mazuy model estimation, and the Omega investment efficiency index were determined, and the differences in the obtained results between the groups were examined. Finally, all funds were clustered using the Ward method.",

The extent of this bias is substantial as verified by a bootstrap approach. We present an alternative estimation equation for future expected one-period returns based on current and past implied rates of return that is superior to simple estimators based on historical returns. The reason for this superiority is a lower variance of estimation results and not the circumvention of the discount rate effect typically stated as a major problem of estimators based on historical return realizations. The superiority of this new approach for portfolio selection purposes is verified numerically for our bootstrap environment and empirically for real capital market data.",

        "abstract": "The estimation of expected security returns is one of the major tasks for the practical implementation of the Markowitz portfolio optimization. Against this background, in 1992 Black and Litterman developed an approach based on (theoretically established) expected equili-brium returns which accounts for subjective investors' views as well. In contrast to historical estimated returns, which lead to extreme asset weights within the Markowitz optimization, the Black-Litterman model generally results in balanced portfolio weights. However, the existence of investors' views is crucial for the Black-Litterman model and with absent views no active portfolio management is possible. Moreover, problems with the implementation of the model arise, as analysts' forecasts are typically not available in the way they are needed for the Black-Litterman-approach. In this context we present how analysts' dividend forecasts can be used to determine an a-priori-estimation of the expected returns and how they can be integrated into the Black-Litterman model. For this purpose, confidences of the investors' views are determined from the number of analysts' forecasts as well as from a Monte-Carlo simulation. After introducing our two methods of view generation, we examine the effects of the Black-Litterman approach on portfolio weights in an empirical study. Finally, the perfor-mance of the Black-Litterman model is compared to alternative portfolio allocation strategies in an out-of-sample study.",

We propose an integrated approach, using copulas for pairs selection and trading. Essentially, we fit t-copulas to all possible combinations of pairs in a 12 month formation period. Next, we run a 48 month in-sample pseudo-trading to assess the profitability of mispricing signals derived from the conditional marginal distribution functions of the t-copula. Finally, the most suitable pairs based on the pseudo-trading are determined, relying on profitability criteria and dependence measures. The top pairs are transferred to a 12 month trading period, and traded with individualized exit thresholds. In particular, we differentiate between pairs exhibiting mean-reversion and momentum effects and apply idiosyncratic take-profit and stop-loss rules. For the top 5 mean-reversion pairs, we find out-of-sample returns of 7.98 percent per year; the top 5 momentum pairs yield 7.22 percent per year. Return standard deviations are low, leading to annualized Sharpe ratios of 1.52 (top 5 mean-reversion) and 1.33 (top 5 momentum), respectively. Since we implement this strategy on a highly liquid stock universe, our findings pose a severe challenge to the semi-strong form of market efficiency and demonstrate a sophisticated yet profitable alternative to classical pairs trading.",

The interest rate on the fixed leg is closely related to the yields on the securities of the same tenure and currency.

In this context, using daily data for the period August 2008 \u00c3\u00af\u00c2\u00bf\u00c2\u00bd January 2012, this study investigates the level relationship between the cross currency swap rates and treasury bond yields of 1-month to 4-year tenures by the cointegration testing procedure suggested by Pesaran, Shin and Smith (PSS). Our empirical results indicate that, at shorter tenures, cross currency swap rates and treasury bond yields have a one-to-one long-run equilibrium relationship and hence the deviations from the equilibrium are quickly arbitraged away. On the other hand, the relationship becomes weaker as the tenure exceeds 6 months and completely disappears after 1 year.

In this paper, we re-investigate this relationship. We argue that the impact of idiosyncratic volatility on stock return is contextual, i.e., depending on the stocks\u00e2\u0080\u0099 attributes. We focus on stocks\u00e2\u0080\u0099 quality measures. We hypothesize that for companies with high quality measures, the idiosyncratic volatility would have a positive impact on stock return, as it is more likely to be idiosyncratic volatilities on the good side, while on the other hand, for companies with bad qualities, higher idiosyncratic volatility might lead to negative return, as these companies are facing larger default probabilities due to their higher idiosyncratic volatilities. Our empirical results show that within our expectations, for stocks with higher quality measures there is a positive and significant relationship between stocks\u00e2\u0080\u0099 future return and their idiosyncratic volatility, while the story for stocks with lower quality measures is mixed. Our research will contribute to the idiosyncratic volatility literature by providing a thorough and conditional analysis about its impact on stock returns.

The results document that Social Entrepreneurship funds demonstrated positive returns across the three phases, while most of the other subcategories plunged into negative zone. Our findings on style analysis suggest that fund managers have been drifting from high risk option to low risk in terms of size and investment strategy.

If it is pervasive, the Momentum effect should be present in the Chilean market as well. From the perspective of the existing literature, this is an out-of-sample test of the effect and thus constitutes our main motivation. This paper mainly follows the methodology proposed by Jegadeesh and Titman (1993, 2001) and finds a strong presence of the momentum effect. Ignoring transaction costs, trading strategies consisting of buying past winners and selling past losers, earn significant abnormal returns in the period July 1991 - September 2008. We also study possible empirical regularities in this behavior, finding non discernible patterns in performance. Nonetheless, such patterns arise in terms of persistence: aggregate economic shocks affect the profit levels from a Momentum-based strategy but do not affect its statistically significant presence throughout the business cycle.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we first examine the presence of monthly calendar anomaly in Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) using aggregate and firm-level monthly stock returns. Secondly, we classify the sample firms into low-beta, medium-beta, and high-beta firms to examine the monthly anomaly of stock returns for firms having different level of systematic risk. By considering the stochastic dominance approach (SDA), we employ the simulation based method of Barrett and Donald (2003) to identify the dominant month over the period from January 2000 to December 2017. We find significant evidence of the existence of the January effect in both firm and market stock returns. We also find that the January effect exists more prominently in both low-risk and high-risk firms categorised based on their systematic risk. On the other end of the continuum, for moderately risky firms, there is strong evidence of the presence of the December effect. One of possible explanations of the January effect is the yearend bonus received in the month of January. Such bonuses are generally used to purchase stocks, causing the bullish trend of stock prices in January. However, the evidence of the January anomaly in both low-beta and high-beta portfolios returns is puzzling, suggesting that investors may invest in both low- and high-risk stocks when enthusiastically investing in stock market. The findings of the paper suggest that investors may get abnormal returns by forecasting stock return patterns and designing their investment strategies by taking into account the January and December effects and the level of systematic risk associated with the firms.",

        "title": "THE MULTIFACTORIAL PASTOR-STAMBAUGH MODEL: EXPLAINING THE IMPACT OF LIQUIDITY ON THE RATE OF RETURN BASED ON THE EXAMPLE OF THE WARSAW STOCK EXCHANGE",
        "abstract": "Research background: The liquidity of assets in the financial market is under-stood gener-ally as costs, and the easiest way in which different types of assets can be converted into cash, or to put it simply, sold at the currently available price on the market. For a considerable period of time this category had not been duly considered in the framework of modern finance theory. As a result, a number of basic models constructed within the framework of this theory in its classical form did not include problems with liquidity. This applies to a number of aspects related to liquidity, with one of the most important being the relationship between the liquidity of trading in shares and the results obtained from these rates of return. Purpose of the article: The aim of the article is to determine whether the rate of return on shares increases with the increase in share liquidity and the incremental rate of return on this account decreases with increasing liquidity. The applied re-search methodology is similar to that described by Pastor and Stambaugh (2003). The model used in the empirical study is the expanded model of Fama and Francha (1993) for the liquidity factor. Methods: In this paper I present various factors which will affect the liquidity. The paper will also provide the results of research concerning the relations between spread and stock return on the Warsaw Stock Exchange (WSE). The evidence drawn from WSE stock returns over the period 2004\u00e2\u0080\u00932012 indicates that Amihuda measure and other variables have a significant effect on stock return using the multifactorial Pastor-Stambaugh. Findings & Value added: In the case of the Polish market, it can be stated that in the analysis based on the Pastor-Stambaugh model not all the variables included in this model are statistically significant. However, directional parameters associated with liquidity risk were statistically significant in all analyzed periods, which allows us to confirm the hypothesis that liquidity has a significant influence on the rate of return on shares listed on the Stock Exchange in Warsaw.",

Results from our non-Gaussian state space model, which is an improvement over Conard and Kaul (1988), show that the conditional distribution has a stable of 1.748 and normality is rejected even after accounting for GARCH. There exists a statistically significant predictable component in the KSE 100 excess stock returns.

We employ the traditional CAPM combined with co-skewness and co-kurtosis representing nonlinear shape in risk measurement to estimate return generating under quantile regression in descending order by sorting equally weighted portfolios. The findings show that three of premium including market premium, co-skewness premium and co-kurtosis premium has influenced stock return in each country by 1%; 5%; 10% significance level with five-quantile regression approach. Then, our models with higher co-moments have better explanation for securities in emerging markets rather than traditional CAPM. Importantly, the investors should add more co-skewness securities and eliminate co-kurtosis (or less this factor) to generate more returns among 25 developing markets.",

        "abstract": "Research background: A current strand of the financial literature is focusing on detecting inefficiencies, such as the day-of-the-week effect, in the cryptocurrency market. However, these studies are not considering that there are no daily closes in this market, and it is possible to trade cryptocurrencies on a continuous basis. This fact may have led to biases in previous empirical results. Purpose of the article: We propose to analyse the day-of-the-week effect on the Bitcoin from an alternative perspective where each hourly data in a day is considered an event. Focusing on that objective, we employ hourly closing prices for Bitcoin which are taken from the Kraken exchange, one of the world leading exchanges and trading platforms in the cryptocurrency markets, for the period spanning from January 2016 to December 2021. Methods: Contrary to the previous empirical evidence, we do not calculate daily returns, but rather the first stage of our proposed approach is devoted to analysing the hourly mean returns for each of the 24 hours of the day for each day of the week. We look for statistically significant hourly mean returns that could advance the importance of the hourly differentiation in the Bitcoin market. In a second stage, we calculate different post-event cumulative returns which are defined as the change in log prices over a time interval. Finally, we propose different investment strategies simply based on the significant hourly mean returns we obtain and we evaluate their performance in terms of the Sharpe ratio. Findings & value added: We contribute to the debate about the degree of Bitcoin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s market efficiency by providing an alternative methodology based on an event study hourly approach. Furthermore, we provide evidence that by investing in different post-event hourly windows it is possible to outperform the classic buy-and-hold strategy.",

Specifically, focusing attention on \"interested\" legislators' behavior captures important information seemingly ignored by the market. A long-short portfolio based on these legislators' views earns abnormal returns of over 90 basis points per month following the passage of legislation. Further, the more complex the legislation, the more difficulty the market has in assessing the impact of these bills.

We use the formation of World War II Japanese Internment Camps to isolate exogenous shocks to local ethnic populations, and identify a causal link between local networks and firm trade links. Firms that exploit their local networks (strategic traders) see significant increases in future sales growth and profitability, and outperform other importers and exporters by 5%-7% per year in risk-adjusted stock returns.

Classification is done by a generalized linear model which includes improved versions of midpoint, tick, and bid/ask tests. The model also considers the relative strengths of these tests, can account for market microstructure peculiarities, and allows for autocorrelations and cross-correlations in trade direction. The correlation modeling corrects for pseudoreplication, yielding more accurate standard errors and fixed effect estimates. Further, the model estimates probabilities of correct classification. The model is compared to various trade classification methods using a sample of 2,836 domestic US stocks from an unexplored, recent, and readily-available dataset. Out of sample, modeled classifications are 1-2% more accurate overall than current methods; this improvement is consistent across dates, sectors, and locations relative to the inside quote. For Nasdaq and NYSE stocks, 1% and 1.3% of the improvement comes from using relative strengths of the various tests; 0.9% and 0.7% of the improvement, respectively, comes from using some form of estimated quotes.

We use an asymmetric information structure, where participants know different sub-sets of the total information needed to exactly calculate the asset value to be estimated. We find that prices from continuous double auction markets clearly outperform all alternative approaches for aggregating dispersed information and that information lets only the best-informed participants generate excess returns.",

In particular, it examines if mutual funds (which invested in the U.K stock market) that have presented the highest return through one or two years continue the same high performances through the future years. We start our analysis by calculating the annually returns of all funds and the Jensen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s measure of performance (in the context of CAPM). Moreover, we test persistence by constructing two-way tables showing the successful performance over successive two-year and one year period. Afterwards, we simulate a strategy of investing in the top performing mutual funds during the preceding two years. We conclude that in 1990s persistence is weak. We do not find strong evidence that past returns provide information about future returns. As most of the results in relevant studies, our results may be subject to survivorship bias, because we do not include in our sample funds that have ceased to exist or merged or started their operation after 1990 (they do not have complete observations).",

        "abstract": "Research Question: How well do triple leveraged exchange-traded funds (ETFs) issued by ProShares perform and track their underlying indices? Motivation: Prior research on the relative performance and tracking ability of leveraged and inverse ETFs (LETFs) is not conclusive. We re-examine and extend the findings of prior research (Charupat and Miu, 2011; Loviscek et al., 2014). We have a unique set of LETFs more recent and historical price data over a longer sample period, and a unifying methodological framework. Our findings help many investors understand the implications of including LETFs in their portfolios for up to six months. Idea: We examine how well LETFs achieve their objectives using mean deviations and tracking errors of cumulative and holding period returns over various non-overlapping holding periods. Our holding period ranges from one day to six months. We also study how much LETFs deviate from their benchmark indices during high volatile markets. Data: We use daily prices of LETFs and values of their underlying indices from the inception date of each LETF to May 29, 2020. We have data for 2,749 trading days. We retrieve all data from Money.net. Method/Tools: We use three sets of statistical tools to examine the return deviations. They include univariate tests, pooled regression-based alphas, betas, and tracking errors and bootstrapping. Findings: Although tracking errors increase with the number of holding periods, LETFs do well up to six months, and the magnitude of deviations are different for bull and bear ETFs. But, LETFs fail to deliver promised returns during high volatile markets. Our findings complement some prior research and contrast with others and bring some new insights on the performance of LETFs. Contributions: We provide new evidence that LETFs provide premiums or discounts beyond one month up to six months, but they fail to track their indices during high volatile markets.",

Macro aspects encompass the impacts of overall market liquidity, volatility, and global uncertainty events (e.g., the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical conflicts) on market efficiency. Micro aspects focus on cryptocurrency-specific attributes, such as liquidity and volatility levels, and their effects on price delays. Our findings reveal that rising liquidity and declining volatility enhance market efficiency at both macro and micro levels. Furthermore, we observe that during the periods of uncertainty, inefficiencies are exacerbated among less liquid and more volatile cryptocurrencies. We propose that the perceived uncertainties and substantial transaction costs associated with cryptocurrencies that lack liquidity and exhibit high volatility act as deterrents, diminishing the eagerness of active traders to participate in arbitrage trading. Consequently, this leads to inefficiencies in the market. The results of this study offer valuable insights for financial market regulators and authorities as well as investors associated with the crypto market, particularly during the times of financial turmoils.",

The findings of the quantile coherency test demonstrate that the effect varies across sectors and quantiles, demonstrating that different industries react differently to crude oil shocks and that the impact is higher in the long run. The demand shocks are more powerful than the supply and risk shocks. Results show evidence of asymmetric impacts for all but the oil & gas index. The safe-haven property appears mostly against demand and supply shocks and is only visible in the short term. The pandemic outbreak has significantly shifted the direction and magnitude of total and net return connectedness over time. Across quantiles, the oil supply and risk shocks are the net receiver and transmitter, respectively, whereas the demand shocks appear to be the net receiver at extreme quantiles but act as the transmitter when markets are normal. Most sectors are net transmitters at extreme quantiles, while almost all are highly exposed to risk transmission at the median quantile. Regardless of the role they play in risk transmission, demand shocks tend to be the primary risk transmitters for the oil and gas index, while risk shocks appear to decisively spill risk to both equities and supply shocks across quantiles. Three oil shocks improve the prediction of equities during only major events, and the impact is stronger at median quantiles.",

The sample consists of 5-minute returns from the most liquid stocks quoted on the Warsaw Stock Exchange. Within an event-study we show that the appearance of the jumps has a two-fold impact on the market liquidity. On the one hand, jumps coincide with the increase in the transaction costs measured by the quoted spread, and on the other hand jumps are accompanied by the increase in the trading quantity measured by trading volume or the number of trades. The price jumps also coincide with the increase in the Amihud\u00e2\u0080\u0099s illiquidity measure. All these effects are strong but short-lived, which constitutes the evidence for the market resiliency.

In this paper, we propose a multiplicative error model (MEM) for the dynamics of illiquidity. We empirically study the illiquidity and volatility spillover effects in eight developed equity markets during and after the recent financial crisis. We find that equity markets are interdependent, both in terms of volatility and illiquidity. Most markets show an increase in volatility and illiquidity spillover effects during the crisis. Furthermore, we find volatility and illiquidity transmission are highly relevant. Illiquidity is a more important channel than volatility in propagating the shocks in equity markets. Our results show an overall crucial role for illiquidity in US markets in influencing other equity markets' illiquidity and volatility. These findings are of importance for policy makers as well as institutional and private investors.",

By treating macroeconomic variables as external factors to financial market volatility, our study distinguishes between internal financial volatility spillovers and external shocks arising from macroeconomic changes. Our analysis reveals that without macroeconomic shocks, the Stock market predominantly acts as the main source of volatility spillovers, with Crude Oil being the principal spillover recipient. However, the Stock market\u00e2\u0080\u0099s role in driving volatility spillover, especially towards the Crude Oil market, changes markedly in the context of macroeconomic shocks. These shocks exert a more substantial impact on Crude Oil compared to other markets.

We demonstrate that a transparent and replicable approach significantly outperforms standard dictionary-based methods used in the literature while remaining competitive with more complex machine learning algorithms. Aggregating individual message sentiment at half-hour intervals, we provide empirical evidence that online investor sentiment helps forecast intraday stock index returns. After controlling for past market returns, we find that the first half-hour change in investor sentiment predicts the last half-hour S&P 500 index ETF return. Examining users\u00e2\u0080\u0099 self-reported investment approach, holding period and experience level, we find that the intraday sentiment effect is driven by the shift in the sentiment of novice traders.

Its forecasts reverse large, unexpected shocks to realized variances. When using this model to revisit the relation between idiosyncratic risk and returns (the IVOL puzzle), we fail to find a significant relation.

        "abstract": "Using a large representative sample of Indian retail equity investors, many of them new to the stock market, we show that both years of investment experience and feedback from investment returns have significant effects on investor behavior, favored stock styles, and performance. We identify two channels of feedback: performance relative to the market, and the directly-experienced returns to behavior and styles of stock. Both of these vary across investors at a point in time because investors are imperfectly diversified and receive idiosyncratic returns. We find that experienced investors generally behave in a manner more consistent with the recommendations of finance theory, although this tendency is weakened by strong investment performance. High trading profits increase turnover, while high returns to equity styles have a short-term negative and a longer-term positive effect on investors' style demands, possibly reflecting the offsetting effects of disposition bias and style chasing.We document high returns on a portfolio of stocks held by experienced investors, and on individual Indian stocks with an experienced and low-turnover investor base.",

        "abstract": "The impact that informed and uninformed agents have on market prices is crucial for informational issues in financial markets. Informed trades are associated with institutional operators while uninformed trades are executed on behalf of retail investors. Using high-frequency data from Euronext Paris, I estimate a model where I take into account traders' identities at transaction level. The results show that when the identities of the traders are different on the two sides of the market, stock prices follow the direction indicated by institutional agents. This means that when the buyer is an informed operator and the seller is a retail one, the former transmits a positive pressure to the market. Conversely, when the seller is an institutional agent and the buyer is an uninformed one market prices depress. There is no significant effect when the agent types are the same on both market sides. Since traders' identities are concealed in Euronext Paris, the last part of the paper discusses the informational content implicitly provided by observed market variables. Institutional trading is found to increase throughout the day, whereas no evidence of informed trading is found during specific time periods of the continuous auction, except for the first thirty minutes of the day where there are more uninformed trades. Institutional trading is more common during periods of low price changes and high frequency of transactions. Price variations show that informed agents are usually able to trade at better price conditions. Finally, the tick-test algorithm strongly confirms that informed traders always act as initiators of market transactions.",

We use high-frequency data, precise announcement times and market-based forecasts to measure the reaction of bill and bond yields to news. The period covered is from January 1994 to September 1997. We find that announcements about US economic news have had a large impact on yields in Australia \u00e2\u0080\u0093 especially bond yields. Of the domestic announcements, the market responds to: monetary policy announcements, the CPI, the labour force and AWOTE, as well as a range of other economic statistics. We also find that the fixed-interest market seems to distinguish between the information contained in different economic announcements and that traders systematically respond to the size and direction of any unanticipated component of these announcements. The results suggest that the market perceives that information on prices, employment and wages is more important in the Reserve Bank\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decisions about monetary policy than are other indicators of economic activity. Taken in sum, the results also suggest some consistency of response to news in the fixed-interest market in Australia.",

Contrary to previous literature we show that price-contingent trading is the profitable equilibrium strategy of large rational agents in efficient markets. The key ingredient is uncertainty about whether a large trader is informed about fundamentals. Even when uninformed, he still learns more from prices than market participants who still wonder about whether he is informed. Therefore, he will trade a non-zero quantity based on past prices, whose direction ? trend-following or contrarian ? depends on parameters. When informed, he will trade on that information and disregard the algorithm. One implication is that future order flow is predictable even if markets are semi-strong efficient by construction.",

The evidence from the GSADF test results indicates that the prices of 13 out of 20 fan tokens and the three cryptocurrencies have explosive periods associated with bubbles. Our results also show that the percentage of bubble days is between 0 % and 5% for all fan tokens. Among the 13 fan tokens exhibiting bubble behavior in their prices, nine have multiple sub-periods associated with bubbles, while only four tokens have a single sub-period with explosive prices. Bubbles in token prices are short-lived bubbles; most last for a few days. As a robustness analysis, we also perform LPPLS (Log-Periodic Power Law Singularity), providing similar results.

We employed the multivariate regression approach after sorting six portfolios according to size and book-to-market. The constituent stocks were selected to represent each country of our sample. In order to homogenize the returns we used the spot exchange rates of non-euro-area countries to convert prices into euros. Since we were analyzing on a global portfolio level we used the MSCI EMU index as the proxy for the market portfolio. Daily returns were employed for a period of five years from January 2002 to December 2006. The results were not very encouraging for the three-factor model. Except for one portfolio, the three-factor model failed to explain the variations in returns, and even in the single portfolio that demonstrated size and value premiums, the market premium was insignificant. Our findings are consistent with Griffin (2002), who suggested that the three-factor model is domestic in nature and performs poorly for global portfolios.",

We construct a new four-fold beta decomposition, distinguishing cash flow and discount rate betas in up and down markets. Using CRSP data over 1963-2008, we find that the downside cash flow beta and downside discount rate beta carry the largest premia. We subject our result to an extensive number of robustness checks. Overall, downside cash flow risk is priced most consistently across different samples, periods, and return decomposition methods, and is the only component of \u00c3\u0098; that has significant out-of-sample predictive ability. The downside cash flow risk premium is mainly attributable to small stocks. The risk premium for large stocks appears much more driven by a compensation for symmetric, cash flow related risk. Finally, we multiply our premia estimates by average betas to compute the contribution of the different risk components to realized average returns. We find that up and down discount rate components dominate the contribution to average returns of downside cash flow risk.",

Such behavior can heavily inflate the false positive rate (FPR) of the CUSUM-based procedure to spuriously signal the presence of an explosive episode. Our modified procedure involves replacing the standard variance estimate in the CUSUM statistics with a nonparametric kernel-based spot variance estimate. We show that the sequence of modified CUSUM statistics has a joint limiting null distribution which is invariant to any time-varying volatility present in the innovations and that this delivers a real-time monitoring procedure whose theoretical FPR is controlled. Simulations show that the modification is effective in controlling the empirical FPR of the procedure, yet sacrifices only a small amount of power to detect explosive episodes, relative to the standard procedure, when the shocks are homoskedastic. An empirical illustration using Bitcoin price data is provided.",

Opposite to the learning of informed traders, learning makes uninformed traders submit less aggressive limit orders and more market orders.

Additionally, we also report that the signals from the coefficients associated to the value factor (HML) must not be undervalued.

We find that 25 news have a significant impact on bond returns and that almost all announcements are incorporated into prices within 20min from the release.",

We find that a momentum spillover strategy exhibits strong structural and time-varying default risk exposures that cause a drag on the profitability of the strategy and lead to large drawdowns if the market cycle turns from a bear to a bull market. By ranking companies on their firm-specific equity return, instead of their total equity return, the default risk exposures halve, the Sharpe ratio doubles and the drawdowns are substantially reduced.",

If arbitrageurs find it more difficult to correct the mispricing of stocks with high idiosyncratic risk, there should be a positive (negative) relation between expected return and idiosyncratic risk for undervalued (overvalued) stocks. We combine several well-known anomalies to measure stock mispricing and proxy stock idiosyncratic risk using an exponential GARCH model for stock returns. We confirm that average stock returns monotonically increase (decrease) with idiosyncratic risk for undervalued (overvalued) stocks. Overall, our results support the importance of idiosyncratic risk as an arbitrage cost.",

We reformulate the well-known Lucas (1982) model by allowing for the existence of monetary policy regimes. The monetary supply is viewed as having two stochastic components: (a) a persistent component that reflects the preferences of the central bank regarding the long-run money supply or inflation target, and (b) a transitory component that represents short-lived interventions. To generate agents\u00e2\u0080\u0099 forecasts, we consider two scenarios: (a) consumers can distinguish the permanent and the transitory components of the money supply (complete information), and (b) consumers face a signal-extraction problem to disentangle permanent and transitory components of the money supply (incomplete information). We simulate the model from a careful estimate of the parameters involved in the model. Numerical simulations reveal that, under complete information, forward unbiasedness cannot be rejected at conventionally significant levels. However, when learning about monetary policy is incorporated, the forward bias can be reproduced without artificially assuming an unreasonable degree of risk aversion.",

Using a sample of 118 European equity funds for the period 2008\u00e2\u0080\u00932017, we extend previous research by focusing, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, on the field of mutual funds. We provide evidence of a robust Halloween effect in the European equity mutual funds market, even after controlling for other seasonal anomalies and dividing our sample according to the size of the funds. We also show that an investment based on such a seasonal anomaly can be more profitable and effective than the Buy & Hold Strategy without any risk increase. The significant higher returns in winter months are also resulting from close to zero or negative average returns during May to October as well as high positive returns during November to April. It is finally concluded that fund managers do not seem to decrease their risk exposure to the equity market during summer periods due to the existence of this anomaly.",

Over the 2006\u00e2\u0080\u00932016 period, we find that the predictive power of option implied volatility spread for future stock returns is significantly greater when implied volatility spread has been more variable in the past.

The first group consists of skilled traders who estimate the trend parameter and have randomly generated bias. The second group has fixed bias to zero, and the third group, most advanced one, is able to estimate the bias parameter. The most interesting result from simulations is that for all model settings the stock market changes its structure at some point with growing number of skilled traders.",

By contrast, we show that it is mainly explained by a decrease in order processing and order imbalance costs.

        "abstract": "We examine the associations between newspapers tone and stock market indices by translating newspapers coverage into human sentiment gauge. Our tone has positive effects on overnight stock returns and negative effects on both intraday returns and conditional volatility. The positive effect of the tone is highly significant on days of sharp price declines and when the tone is calculated using general newspapers. That positive effect, apparently thru opening prices, partly explains the overnight-intraday anomaly. The impact of negative events' coverage is about double the impact of positive events\u00e2\u0080\u0099 coverage. This asymmetry is greater when distinguishing between general and business newspapers.",

In this paper we implement MA strategies using ETFs and examine the performance of such strategies using a variety of risk-adjusted performance measures. We find that relative to the buy-and-hold strategy, MA strategies have lower average returns and Sharpe ratios, but fare better under factor-adjusted performance measures such as the CAPM alpha. We also find that MA strategies become less profitable when they are implemented using ETFs than using their underlying indices. In addition, we propose a quasi-intraday version of the standard MA strategy (QUIMA) that allows investors to trade immediately upon observing MA crossover signals. The QUIMA strategy outperforms the standard one that only trades at the close of a trading day, when the long-term MA lag length is no more than 50 days.",

I start by summarizing the evidence on cross-sectional return predictability and the failure of standard (consumption) CAPM models and their conditional versions to explain these predictability patterns. One response in part of the recent literature is to focus on ad-hoc factor models, which summarize the cross-section of expected returns in parsimonious form, or on production-based approaches, which suggest links between firm characteristics and expected returns. Without imposing restrictions on investor preferences and beliefs, neither one of these two approaches can answer the question why investors price assets the way they do. Within the rational expectations paradigm, recent research that imposes such restrictions has focused on the ICAPM, long-run risks models, as well as frictions and liquidity risk. Approaches based on investor sentiment have focused on the development of empirical proxies for sentiment and for the limits to arbitrage that allow sentiment to affect prices. Empirical work that considers learning and adaptation of investors has worked with out-of-sample tests of cross-sectional predictability.",

In this paper we introduce four new alternative strategies that, while still based on the discrepancy between the CDS market spread and its equity-implied spread, exploit the information provided by the time-varying price discovery of the equity and CDS markets. We implement the strategies for both US and European obligors and find that these outperform traditional arbitrage trading during the financial crisis. Moreover, the new strategies show higher Sharpe ratios when CDS and equity-implied spreads are cointegrated. The correlation of the new trading rules with hedge fund index returns is low or negative even during the crisis, which suggests that the new rules can be used for portfolio diversification at times when risk reduction is hard to achieve.",

        "abstract": "Abstract We study the interrelation among the post-earnings announcement drift (PEAD) and momentum short-term anomalies, and the reversal long-term anomaly. Some theories argue that PEAD and momentum are a consequence of underreaction to new information on the market. One theory in particular, suggests that this underreaction occurs because investors are unsure about their interpretations of the impact of new information on the fundamental price, and look for the market consensus interpretation for guidance. This learning process takes time, and until it is complete, prices do not fully incorporate the new information. Furthermore, the more difficult it is to interpret the new information, the more prices underreact to the new information arrival, and the longer it takes for them to fully incorporate this information. On the other hand, there are investors that rely too much on past performance (known as \u00e2\u0080\u009ctrend chasers\u00e2\u0080\u009d). These investors, motivated by the short-term performance during the underreaction period, push prices beyond their fundamentals, resulting in an overreaction whose correction generates long-run reversal. And the more difficult it is to interpret new information, the more likely it is that trend chasers create overreaction, leading to stronger reversals in the future. Therefore, uncertainty about the interpretation of new information can potentially link today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reversal to past momentum and PEAD. Our major goal is to test this hypothesis. For that, we use a multifactor risk-based model and NYSE-AMEX stock prices for the period starting at January 1975 to December 2010. Our main conclusion points for a statistical and economical relation between past PEAD and reversal. The higher the returns of the PEAD zero-investment portfolio two years ago, the higher the returns of the reversal zero-investment portfolio today.",

The third starts at January of 1999 and goes until the end of the sample. It is used monthly data. Models that allows for some similarities across the regimes are also estimated and tested. The models are estimated using the Generalized Reduced-Rank Regressions developed by Hansen (2003).

The data collected covered the period from 31/12/2016 to 23/03/2020 and contained financial data of the companies listed on both stock markets of the Warsaw Stock Exchange (WSE), i.e. on the Main Market and NewConnect.

We combine the Diebold and Yilmaz (2012) spillover index and the quantile connectedness approach developed by Ando et al. (2022) in order to capture financial markets exhibiting higher potential risk and to assess their extreme dependence. The main results show a strong time-varying connectedness between focal asset classes during major crisis periods, including the oil price crash, the China-US trade conflict, the coronavirus crisis and the war between Russia and Ukraine. The network analysis reveals that WTI, heating oil and green bonds act as net transmitters of risk, while the other asset classes serve as net receivers of spillovers. In extreme conditions, spillovers between energy commodities, green bonds and non-green bonds are asymmetric, given that they are not equal in the upper and lower quantiles. Green bonds offer greater diversification benefits when coupled with WTI, heating oil, gasoline, and natural gas, though with varying portfolio weights.",

In the out-of-sample test, the strategy is able to generate abnormal risk-adjusted returns, which suggests that these currency markets might be weak-form inefficient.",

The model is used to structurally identify the component of order flow that is due to marketwide private information. Trades driven by marketwide private information display very little or no correlation with the first principal component of order flow. This finding implies that a simple statistical factor is a poor measure of marketwide private information. Moreover, the model suggests that the previously documented comovement in order flow captures mostly common variation in liquidity trades. We find that marketwide private information obtained from equity market data forecasts industry stock returns and foreign exchange returns consistent with Evans and Lyons' (2004a) model of exchange rate determination.",

The diverse nature of the regressors caters for applications in a variety of settings. In addition, we extend the analysis to allow the stationary regressor to be instead locally stationary, and we allow the models to include a linear form of the integrated variable. Heteroscedasticity is allowed for in all models. We propose an estimation strategy based on orthogonal series expansion that takes account of the different type of stationarity/nonstationarity possessed by each covariate. We establish pointwise asymptotic distribution theory jointly for all estimators of unknown functions and also show the conventional optimal convergence rates jointly in the L2 sense. In spite of the entanglement of different kinds of regressors, we can separate out the distribution theory for each estimator. We provide Monte Carlo simulations that establish the favorable properties of our procedures in moderate sized samples. Finally, we apply our techniques to the study of a pairs trading strategy.",

However, such phenomenon has received scarce attention in the Spanish Market.In this paper, we present a meticulous analysis of the momentum profits in this market, with specialconcern on its possible sources. Consistent with the evidence obtained in other markets, themomentum strategy yields important profits that can not be explained neither by the cross-sectiondispersion of the expected returns nor by a positive autocorrelation in the return generating factor/s.Such phenomenon seems to be driven by a positive autocorrelation in the specific return component,which seriously questions the market efficiency hypothesis. Moreover, the momentum effectevidenced in the Spanish market shows some peculiarities that make it different from the existing onein other countries. Specifically, it seems to disappear in the nineties and does not show any seasonalityin January.

Both phenomena, in turn, occur whenever traders speculate on short-run price movements. For a given, positive level of residual payoff uncertainty, over-reliance on public information obtains if noise trade displays low persistence. This defines a \"Keynesian\" region; the complementary region is \"Hayekian\" in that prices are systematically closer to fundamentals than average expectations. The standard case of no residual uncertainty and noise trading following a random walk is on the frontier of the two regions and identifies the set of deep parameters for which traders abide by Keynes' dictum of concentrating on an asset \"long term prospects and those only.\" The analysis explains accommodation and trend chasing strategies as well as momentum and reversal.",

        "abstract": "A blockchain replaces central counterparties with time-consuming consensus protocols to record the transfer of ownership. This settlement latency slows cross-exchange trading, exposing arbitrageurs to price risk. Off-chain settlement, instead, exposes arbitrageurs to costly default risk. We show with Bitcoin network and order book data that cross-exchange price differences coincide with periods of high settlement latency, asset flows chase arbitrage opportunities, and price differences across exchanges with low default risk are smaller. Blockchain-based trading thus faces a dilemma: Reliable consensus protocols require time-consuming settlement latency, leading to arbitrage limits. Circumventing such arbitrage costs is possible only by reinstalling trusted intermediation, which mitigates default risk.",

        "abstract": "This paper shows that the systematic risk (or \"beta\") of individual stocks increases by an economically and statistically signi\u00e2\u0080\u00a6cant amount on days of firm-specific news announcements, and reverts to its average level two to five days later. We employ intra-daily data and recent advances in econometric theory to obtain daily firm-level estimates of beta for all constituents of the S&P 500 index over the period 1995-2006, and estimate the behavior of beta around the dates of over 22,000 quarterly earnings announcements. We find that the increase in beta is larger for more liquid and more visible stocks, and for announcements with greater information content and higher ex-ante uncertainty. We also find important differences in the behavior of beta across different industries. Our analysis reveals that changes in beta around news announcements are mostly driven by an increase in the covariance of announcing firms with other firms in the market. We provide a simple model of investors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 expectations formation that helps explain our empirical findings: changes in beta can be generated by investors learning about the profitability of a given firm by using information on other firms.",

        "abstract": "We study a simple rational expectations (RE) model whose asset pricing implications address some of the short-run mispricings, informational inefficiencies, and overreactions observed in real markets, without a need to resort to behavioral assumptions. We accomplish this by relying on the plausible joint frictions of immediacy risk (excution risk) and asset-specific orders (the demand function for asset a cannot be made contingent on the price of any asset other than a). These frictions induce allocational and informational inefficiencies akin to the ones observed in reality. At the closed-form RE Equilibrium it is shown that arbitrage opportunities occur which could not have occured in a standard model. A certain and precise degree of informativeness of prices to the traders is lost because the decision making process becomes endogenously segmented and decentralized within the same decision making entity (distinct \"trading desks\"). It is shown that, compared to the frictionless benchmark case, volatility is affected at a RE Equlibrium, and that asset prices are likely to overreact to news. Interestingly, the coordination problem arising from limited communication, even though dramatically changing demand functions, does not lead to welfare losses.",

This arbitrage asymmetry explains the negative relation between idiosyncratic volatility (IVOL) and average return. The IVOL effect is negative among overpriced stocks but positive among underpriced stocks, with mispricing determined by combining 11 return anomalies. The negative effect is stronger, consistent with asymmetry in risks and other impediments inhibiting arbitrageurs in exploiting overpricing. Aggregating across all stocks therefore yields a negative relation, explaining the IVOL puzzle.

While the topic has been analyzed in previous studies such as Gallo and Zhang (2009) and Yunus (2009) among others, this paper is of significant contribution to existing studies since we compare results from different cointegration methodologies and explicitly control for instability in cointegration relationships and deviations from normality. Furthermore, the analyzed time period is longer than in previous studies and ranges from 1990 to 2009 covering 20 years. In line with previous studies, the empirical results indicate several cointegration relationships between national real estate stock markets. However, it is also shown that most cointegration relationships are unstable and that the results from cointegration methodologies suggested by Engle and Granger (1987) and Johansen (1988) might be misleading in that common long-run comovements appear to be stronger when structural breaks are considered. Thus, the results indicate that investors would benefit from broadening their investment horizon from their domestic continent to international markets.

Notably, the systematic risk of oil and gas sector was significantly affected during the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and the Shale Oil Revolution (SOR) sub-periods. Our results provide convincing evidence of the positive impact of energy uncertainties on basic material, basic resources, financials, oil and gas, and real estate. On the other hand, we identify the negative impact on consumer goods, consumer services, health care, industrials, and technology industries. These findings have implications for investment and risk management.",

In this paper, we use unconditional and conditional methods, such as the recently proposed high quantile (HQ) extreme value theory (EVT) models of DPOT (Duration-based Peak Over Threshold) and quasi-PORT (peaks over random threshold), to estimate the Value-at-Risk with very small probability values for an adequately long and major financial time series to obtain a reasonable number of violations for backtesting. We also compare these models and other alternative strategies through an out-of-sample accuracy investigation to determine their relative performance within the HQ context.

Using data on analysts' expectations of long run earnings growth for individual companies, we report a number of interelated results which lend support to this hypothesis. First we show that there is no statistically significant relationship between analysts' long run forecasts and subsequent earnings growth, suggesting that analysts' earnings expectations are excessively dispersed. Secondly, we provide evidence that analysts' expectations are reflected in market prices. These two results together imply that the cross-section of stock prices will also be excessively dispersed, so that stocks with low earnings expectations are underpriced and stocks with high earnings expectations are overpriced. As analysts' forecasts errors become apparent, stock prices should adjust accordingly and so excess returns should accrue. We demonstrate that analysts' forecasts are indeed negatively correlated with subsequent excess returns. All hypothesis testing uses panel regression techniques, and to circumvent the problem of cross-sectional dependence in the data we use a generalised method of moments estimator of the parameter covariance matrix.",

Increases in the likelihood of ratification led to stock market gains of exporting firms relative to non-exporters. Moreover, gains were higher in sectors with larger cuts in U.S. import tariffs. Decreases in the likelihood of ratification led to opposite stock market reactions. Results for the impact of Canadian tariff reductions are less conclusive but most specifications suggest that exporters also gained relative to non-exporters in response to such reductions. Translating stock market gains into implied profit changes, I find that CUSFTA increased expected per-period profits of exporters by around 6-7% relative to non-exporters.",

We document large, recurrent arbitrage opportunities in cryptocurrency prices relative to fiat currencies across exchanges, which often persist for weeks. Price deviations are much larger across than within countries, and smaller between cryptocurrencies. Price deviations across countries co-move and open up in times of large appreciations of the Bitcoin. Countries that on average have a higher premium over the US Bitcoin price also see a bigger widening of arbitrage deviations in times of large appreciations of the Bitcoin. Finally, we decompose signed volume on each exchange into a common and an idiosyncratic component. We show that the common component explains up to 85% of Bitcoin returns and that the idiosyncratic components play an important role in explaining the size of the arbitrage spreads between exchanges.",

The pre-crisis period is characterized by increasing realized and, especially, option-implied returns. This translates into transient unsustainable price growth that may be identified as a bubble.

The literature attributes this nexus to two channels: pro-cyclical public spending for national sports or a sort of q-driven investment activity induced by national sporting success. To analyze whether such a relationship can be established using German data, we adhere to a primarily descriptive methodology. We examine daily stock market data and macroeconomic time series in annual and quarterly frequency for a relationship between these data and the results of roughly 500 matches played by the German national soccer squad in the period from 1959 to 2004. Our methods of choice are techniques from time series analysis and event study analysis. We are able to establish a nexus in the decades prior to German reunification. This relationship fades in the period after reunification. As a result the nexus for the total period is obscured and asymmetric. For the stock market, it is predominantly a pessimistic market that coincides with losses of the national team. As it is virtually impossible to disentangle the spending channel from q-driven investment effects, we attribute this finding to both disproportionate expectations and a realignment of public spending in the aftermath of reunification.",

More notably, Tonality conveys substantial incremental information in that it predicts errors in Federal Reserve and even in private-sector point forecasts of unemployment and GDP up to four quarters ahead.

Higher Tonality also predicts positive monetary policy (fed funds rate) surprises and higher stock returns up to four quarters ahead.

If observed in real time, tonality would have been most informative about economic prospects and stock returns when economic uncertainty was high or when point forecasts called for subpar GDP growth.",

These findings are consistent with a trading mechanism where investors choose to exploit perceived stock underpricing via OTM options due to their embedded leverage, rather than directly buying the underlying stock to avoid exposure to its potential downside. Due to the absence of severe limits-to-arbitrage for the long-side, the price correction signalled by RNS is very quick, typically overnight.",

We construct a comprehensive database of corporate apologies issued for major chemical disasters between 1985 and 2017. Results from event studies and cross-sectional regressions suggest that 1) on average there is no significant stock market response after a firm apologizes; but when we allow for heterogeneity in the type of apologies, we find that 2) some apologies are associated with significant abnormal returns. In particular, firms that shift the blame to others consistently experience positive abnormal returns, while firms that admit to making mistakes tend to face negative stock market reactions in the longer-term. Greater media coverage for the chemical spill and the apology is associated with a negative and positive stock market response, respectively. Our findings are consistent with a signaling theory of apologies and help shed light on corporate crisis management and understanding of what makes an effective apology.",

We also find some evidence that, during the crisis, the CHF and JPY tended to respond more strongly to surprises generating an appreciation than to surprises leading to a depreciation. Both currencies also systematically respond to changes in the general market environment. This result is robust to the use of two measures of the market environment: VIX and on a novel index based on Bloomberg wires.

The proposed test has numerous applications in time series analysis. As an example, it is applied to identify seasonal patterns in 76 national stock markets and 772 cryptocurrency markets to detect trading cycles, determine their length, and test the weak-form efficient market hypothesis. Cryptocurrency markets are shown to be less efficient than national stock markets, with predominantly irregular seasonality periodicity that cannot be reduced to conventional weekly, monthly, or annual cycles.",

In this paper, we show that the above puzzle can be attributed to the time-variation of the exchange rate risk premium (known as forward risk premium). This premium can also explain the failure of the holding-period returns differential to provide unbiased predictions of the future exchange rate changes. To control for the risk premium effects, in this paper we suggest a new forward premium regression framework adjusting the interest rates differential for these effects which are estimated by a two-country term structure model. We provide evidence that the suggested framework can predict the correct direction of the future exchange rate changes for a number of developed countries with liquid currencies.

We find that, on an average day, just over 70% of price discovery occurs on the futures market where bid-ask spreads are lower and trading activity is higher.

        "abstract": "Abstract The forward premium anomaly refers to the fact that changes in spot exchange rates are negatively related to interest rate differentials between home and foreign countries, which is contrary to the predictions of the uncovered interest rate parity (UIRP). We propose a regression model of the interest rate differentials across countries (known as carry trade) adjusted for a time-varying exchange rate risk premium which can explain the anomaly and provide forecasts of exchange rate changes in accordance to the theory. The proposed model is based on estimates of the exchange rate risk premium implied by a simple and empirically attractive two-country affine term structure model with global and local factors. We also show that the forecasting power of the model compares favorably to the random walk model of exchange rates, considered as benchmark in the literature.",

We measure bond liquidity using intraday transactions data and estimate the default component using the term structure of credit default swaps (CDS) spreads. With swap rate as the risk free rate, the estimated nondefault component is generally moderate but statistically significant for AA-, A-, and BBB-rated bonds and increasing in this order. With Treasury rate as the risk free rate, the estimated nondefault component is the largest in basis points for BBB-rated bonds but, as a fraction of yield spreads, it is the largest for AAA-rated bonds. Controlling for the unobservable firm heterogeneity, we find a positive and significant relationship between the nondefault component and illiquidity for investment-grade bonds but no significant relationship for speculative-grade bonds. We also find that the nondefault component comoves with indicators for macroeconomic conditions.",

The evolving literature on Google search investor attention effect suggests that high Google search volumes can predict high returns for the first 1\u00e2\u0080\u00932 weeks, but with a subsequent price reversal. We use a more recent data set that covers the period from 2012 to 2017 in the Indian stock market and employ the quantile regression approach as it alleviates some of the statistical problems to find that high Google search volumes lead to positive returns. Indeed, the high Google search volumes predict positive and significant returns in the subsequent third, fourth and fifth weeks. The Google search volume index performs as a better predictor of the direction as well as the magnitude of the excess returns. The findings infer that the signals from the search volume data could be of benefit construction of profitable trading strategies.",

We find that the skewness of the distribution of economic forecasts is a strong predictor of economic surprises, suggesting that forecasters behave strategically (rational bias) and possess private information. Our results also show that consensus forecasts of US macroeconomic releases embed anchoring. Under these conditions, both economic surprises and the returns of assets that are sensitive to macroeconomic conditions are predictable. Our findings indicate that local equities and bond markets are more predictable than foreign markets, currencies and commodities. Economic surprises are found to link to asset returns very distinctively through the stages of the economic cycle, whereas they strongly depend on economic releases being inflation- or growth-related. Yet, when forecasters fail to correctly forecast the direction of economic surprises, regret becomes a relevant cognitive bias to explain asset price responses. We find that the behavioral and rational biases encountered in US economic forecasting also exists in Continental Europe, the United Kingdom and Japan, albeit, to a lesser extent.",

We show that the ability of aggregate retail order imbalances, contrarian in nature, to predict short-term future returns is significantly enhanced during times of market stress, when market liquidity provisions decline. While a weekly rebalanced portfolio long in stocks purchased and short in stocks sold by retail investors delivers 19% annualized excess returns over a four-factor model from 2002 to 2010, it delivers up to 40% annualized returns in periods of high uncertainty. Despite this high aggregate performance, individual investors do not reap the rewards from liquidity provision because they experience a negative return on the day of their trade and they reverse their trades long after the excess returns from liquidity provision are dissipated. During the financial crisis, French active retail stock traders stepped up to the plate, increased stock holdings, and provided liquidity. In contrast, mutual fund investors fled from delegation by selling their mutual funds.",

We consider two types of investors: a domestic investor who invests in emerging-market assets only (with returns in local currency) and an international investor who invests in both US and emerging-market assets (with returns in US dollars). We establish economically relevant short-run and long-run demand for stocks in several emerging market economies, for both domestic and international investors. From a welfare perspective, however, the myopic demand for emerging-market stocks is much more important than the hedging demand. Further international diversification and foreign currency hedging by the international investor do not alter this conclusion.

The degree of connectedness rises during major crises. The study adds value to the specific strategies for portfolio allocation, rebalancing, and redeployment of stock sectors amid crises. Evidence also reveals that, except for the persistent net transmitter (Financials) and intermediate geared toward net transmitting (Industrials and Consumer Discretionary), all the remaining sectors offered safe-haven benefits during the global financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic.

We extend this argument by conditioning expected stock returns on sentiment dynamics and show that the mispricing of speculative and safe stocks worsens with sentiment continuations but is corrected with sentiment transitions, consistent with the view that the mispricing of these stocks is sentiment-driven. We show that the unconditional contrarian return predictability of sentiment, at least in the short-run, is due to the returns of stocks in sentiment transitions. Results show that ex post, sentiment is a momentum predictor if subsequent sentiment continues; and a contrarian predictor if subsequent sentiment transitions. We also show that the MAX effect can either be positive or negative contingent on sentiment dynamics. The absence of a negative MAX effect following Low sentiment states suggested by prior studies is due to the completely offsetting negative MAX effect when sentiment continues in a Low state and the positive MAX effect when sentiment transitions from a High to a Low state.",

We find that firms are more likely to announce special dividends at the end of a year, especially in the months of November and December. There is a Halloween effect in the announcements, but more importantly, there is a Christmas effect in the propensity and abnormal returns of special dividends. This paper provides initial evidence on the Christmas effect of special dividend payments. It links monthly effects in stock returns and corporate events to explain the likelihood of the occurrence of special dividend announcements. The results of this paper shed light on why corporate events are more likely to occur in some periods, but less likely to occur in others.",

In characterizing the market response, three distinct stages of price formation and liquidity provision are identified. Market expectations around the RBA decision are derived explicitly from 30-Day Interbank futures. The first trade following the RBA decision occurs after 220s on average, and after 234s (1.73 trades) the market has adjusted to the theoretical settlement price. Deviations from theoretical prices post-announcement are common, particularly when a large amount of uncertainty exists around the RBA decision.

Understanding how macroeconomic events shape liquidity in this market is important for a number of market participants, and also helps policy makers assess the efficacy of the policy transmission mechanism. Using high-frequency data, we consider liquidity provision in the period around monetary policy announcements and relate this to prevailing levels of investor sentiment. We are able to contrast changes in liquidity in the gold and silver markets, and across three instruments (futures, ETFs, and physical/bullion). We show that liquidity is removed from the market around 5-minutes prior to the announcement and reverts to normal within 10-minutes (gold market) and 20-minutes (silver market). The magnitude of the liquidity response is determined by both the prevailing level of investor sentiment and the size of the monetary policy surprise \u00e2\u0080\u0093 with the greatest liquidity response (in both speed and magnitude) occurring in the least liquid instruments/markets.

For this purpose, we implement a dynamic modeling approach to define and test for overreactions for interday and various intraday price levels. We find evidence that price overreactions are highly prevalent in the cryptocurrency market for all frequencies, strongly supporting the overreaction hypothesis. This result is largely comparable for cryptocurrency and stock markets despite the fact that both markets are fundamentally different. However, the returns of an overreaction trading strategy are significantly higher for cryptocurrencies due to larger overreactions as the most important factor for profitability. In addition, our results also show that negative overreactions are slightly more prevalent than positive overreactions.",

A dynamic and non-parametric approach is applied on intraday data for four different frequencies (from 1 min to 1 h) and two different sub-periods (pre-Covid-19 pandemic and during Covid-19 pandemic) in order to detect overreaction behavior which is defined as a large change of prices followed by proportional price reversals. Our empirical findings show that the overreaction hypothesis is confirmed for the considered commodity futures. Furthermore, both the number and the amplitude of overreactions is higher during the Covid-19 pandemic. Our findings also indicate that soft and metal commodities show much less overreactions than precious metals and especially energy commodities. In particular, crude oil futures exhibit a different overreaction behavior compared to other commodities since it has a higher number of negative than positive overreactions during the Covid-19 pandemic. We also find that the data frequency is independent of the overreacting behavior in both periods as the results continuously improve when having more observations due to higher frequencies. Finally, we find that extreme overreactions during the Covid-19 pandemic provide a great potential for profitable trading returns, which can be exploited by traders.",

We focus particularly on two emerging stock markets - Russia and China, because of their unique characteristics and performance in the past years. We find that while Russian markets, like the CEEC region, substantially increased their integration with global stock markets, both the Chinese A- and B-share markets continued to move largely independently from global movements and only slightly increased in comovement with regional forces. We provide evidence of a general increase in global comovement of stock markets over the past decade and a decline in the role of regional forces, which imply a decrease of the effectiveness of cross-country hedging strategies.",

We find strong evidence of commonality in informed trading, and a systematic dependence of informed trading on firm characteristics that is largely consistent with intuition and earlier theory and empirical evidence, wherever available. We accordingly decompose informed trading into two components: one that reflects information asymmetry with respect to skilled information processors with potentially private information on systematic factors or who generate a private informational advantage using public data; and another unpredictable component that reflects truly private information, potentially of traditional insiders. We test the pricing relevance of both these components and find that it is only the unpredictable component reflecting truly private information that is priced, and is priced more strongly and in a manner more robust than total informed trading. Our pricing-relevance results strongly support Easley and O'Hara (2004) and do not support Hughes, et al. (2007).",

We show that the ability of aggregate retail order imbalances, contrarian in nature, to predict short-term future returns is significantly enhanced during times of market stress, when market liquidity provisions decline. While a weekly rebalanced portfolio long in stocks purchased and short in stocks sold by retail investors delivers 19% annualized excess returns over a four-factor model from 2002 to 2010, it delivers up to 40% annualized returns in periods of high uncertainty. Despite this high aggregate performance, individual investors do not reap the rewards from liquidity provision because they experience a negative return on the day of their trade and they reverse their trades long after the excess returns from liquidity provision are dissipated. During the financial crisis, French active retail stock traders stepped up to the plate, increased stock holdings, and provided liquidity. In contrast, mutual fund investors fled from delegation by selling their mutual funds.",

We find evidence of commonality in informed trading, and a systematic dependence of the level of informed trading on firm characteristics, such as, tick size, the existence of options, and the size of the ownership stake of outside parties. Most importantly, we find that the residual level of in-formed trading is the component of informed trading most strongly related to required returns.

Notably, certain sectors, including oil and gas, utilities, metals & mining, financials, consumer goods, and services exerted more influence on other sectors, while chemicals, transport, and telecoms were influenced by other sectors. These insights are crucial for comprehending the financial implications of the ongoing conflict on the local economy, providing valuable guidance to portfolio managers, investors, and policymakers in devising effective financial strategies.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we extend the model of Easley and O'Hara (1992) to allow the arrival rates of informed and uninformed trades to be time-varying and forecastable. We specify a generalized autoregressive bivariate process for the arrival rates of informed and uninformed trades and estimate the model on 16 actively traded stocks on the New York Stock Exchange over 15 years of transaction data. Our results show that uninformed trades are highly persistent. Uninformed order arrivals clump together, with high uninformed volume days likely to follow high uninformed volume days, and conversely. This behavior is consistent with the passive characterization of the uninformed found in the literature. But we do find an important difference in how the uninformed behave; they avoid trading when the informed are forecasted to be present. Informed trades also exhibit complex patterns, but these patterns are not consistent with the strategic behavior posited in the literature. The informed do not appear to hide in order flow, but instead they trade persistently. We also investigate the correlation between the arrival rates of trades and trade composition on market volatility, liquidity and depth. We find that although volatility increases with the forecasted arrival rates of total trades, it is relatively independent of the forecasted composition of the trade. We use the opening bid-ask spread as a measure of market liquidity. We find that as the number of trades increases over time, the relative proportion of informed trades decreases and hence, spreads become narrower and the market becomes more liquid. Finally, we compute the price impact curve of consecutive buy orders and report the half life of the price impact as a measure of market depth. We find a positive correlation between the half life and total trades indicating that the market is deeper in presence of more trades.",

We define sentiment risk as the sensitivity of stock returns to investor sentiment in financial markets. We incorporate a broad range of financial market variables in measuring financial conditions and use this as a proxy for market-wide investor sentiment. The paper distinguishes between rational and irrational (noisy) investor sentiment. Initial findings indicate a strong role for rational sentiment risk in the returns of FTSE All-Share stocks. However, further analysis reveals that this sentiment risk pricing is detected in the FTSE All-Share subgroup of FTSE small-cap stocks, while no evidence of sentiment risk pricing is found among the FTSE All-Share subgroups of FTSE 250 and FTSE 100 stocks. Our paper makes a key contribution by identifying that evidence of rational sentiment risk pricing disappears after controlling for the liquidity risk features of stocks. More generally, our findings point to a strong relation between sentiment risk and liquidity risk in stock returns and to the need for careful disentangling of sentiment versus liquidity effects.",

The second system, with macroeconomic factor instability effects as Conditional mean, examine the CCC and DCC between different sectors. The main result supports the hypotheses of DCC. The DCC provides evidence of cross border relationship between sectors and macro economic instability factors have significant effect on the mean of returns evolutions (at 5% or 10% level).

Results reveal the absence of cointegration over the sample period, with important differences prior and after 2010 in both maturities.

Employing a two-stage-least-squares (2SLS) approach, I isolate the causal effect of hedge funds\u00e2\u0080\u0099 net flow on CHF returns, taking into account reverse causality. The analysis reveals that hedge funds\u00e2\u0080\u0099 net flow significantly impacts CHF returns, with a net buying of one billion leading to an approximate 0.4% increase in returns. In contrast, the net flow from other market participants has a negligible impact, even when potential reverse causality is dismissed. This influence of hedge funds\u00e2\u0080\u0099 net flow becomes particularly noticeable on days when the Swiss National Bank (SNB) delivers contractionary monetary policy surprises. On such days, even a small surprise amplifies the impact of hedge funds\u00e2\u0080\u0099 net flow significantly. The analysis of market participants\u00e2\u0080\u0099 trading prices substantiates the hypothesis that hedge funds, due to their expertise in FX forecasting and best execution as well as superior transaction timing abilities, in aggregate tend to trade at more advantageous prices than other market participants.",

Crashes were more likely when momentum had recently performed well (both eras), interest rates were relatively low (1867?1907), or momentum had recently outperformed the stock market (CRSP era) - times when borrowing or attracting return chasing ?blind capital? would have been easier. We argue based on a stylized model and simulated outcomes from a richer model that a money manager who competes for funds from return-chasing investors and is compensated via fees that are convex in the amount of money managed and the return on that money has an incentive to remain invested in momentum even when the crash risk is known to be high.",

To decompose composite monetary policy surprises into these separate components, we exploit differences in central bank and private sector forecasts to construct a measure of Federal Reserve private information. Contractionary monetary policy shocks of either type cause a fall in stock prices with exogenous shocks having a larger negative effect. However there is an important asymmetry; when FOMC meetings are unscheduled or when the fed funds rate reverses direction, stock prices actually rise in response to a contractionary Delphic shock.",

The results indicate that returns on cryptocurrencies increase significantly during Chinese holiday periods. Additionally, we use textual analysis to construct an investor sentiment indicator and find that positive investor sentiment boosts cryptocurrency market returns. However, when positive investor sentiment prevails in the cryptocurrency market, the holiday effect weakens, implying that positive investor sentiment attenuates the holiday effect. Robustness tests based on the Bitcoin market generate consistent results. Moreover, this study explores the mechanisms underlying the cryptocurrency holiday effect and examines the impact of epidemic transmission risk and heterogeneity characteristics on this phenomenon. These findings offer novel insights into the impact of Chinese statutory holidays on the cryptocurrency market and illuminate the role of investor sentiment in this market.",

This study is the first to use quantile-frequency spillover, quadruple wavelet coherence, and wavelet quantile correlation methodologies to facilitate these analyses. The total connectedness index value is 70%, which is much higher in both the upper and lower quantiles. Under normal market conditions, short-term connectedness significantly exceeds long-term connectedness. Levels of ETF-uncertainty indicator connectedness increase under extreme market conditions; most technology ETFs are net spillover transmitters and uncertainty indices net spillover receivers, indicating the contagion risk of ETF investments. We show that while greater ETF-uncertainty index connectedness may benefit portfolio diversification, large fluctuations in technology EFTs can result in financial instability due to high market volatility. In the long term, the joint effects of uncertainty indices on ETFs are significant, with negative correlations between ETFs and uncertainties at different frequencies, supporting the potential role of uncertainty indices in hedging technology ETF portfolio risks. Dynamic portfolio rebalancing, scenario analysis, and stress testing may help to manage the effects of high connectedness.",

        "abstract": "The possibility of random walk movements in the log-returns of exchange rate series as well as the characterization of returns by periods of tranquility and volatility is of interest in financial time series modelling. These features make the analysis of exchange rates to be important in the design of policy, portfolio and risk management whenever international trade and finance is discussed. This paper investigated the level of exchange rates market efficiency and volatility at three market phases of US Dollar-South African Rands and US Dollars-British Pounds exchange rates for the daily periods from 2 January 1995 to 8 June 2016. This paper applied the modified Hurst exponent' and volatility modelling techniques on the series log-returns, absolute and squared log-returns used as proxies to volatility. The results of the modified Hurst exponent techniques on the log-returns and squared log-returns show that the future path of the exchange rates returns in these markets are not governed by their immediate past in the second and third identified phases. Thus, the two markets have been in the state of weak form of efficiency since 2001 to the current transition, with UK exchange rate market more efficient than South African exchange rate market. Using the efficiency and volatility indices to classify the two exchange rate markets as well as the market phases, we observe similar transition in the level of market efficiency in these markets, this which is as a result of trade partnership between the two countries. In terms of market volatility, we cannot make a clearer judgement between the two economies. This paper has repositioned the stability foreign exchange rates of South Africa, a member of Group of 20 (G20) countries, with that of a member of the G7 countries, that is, the UK. To the government, risk and portfolio managers, the findings emanating from this paper indicated that the South Africa's Rand is also stable like the British Pound, and thus, can be traded on the international currency market without fear of excessive loss/gain.",

This is motivated by the Lucas island model which suggests an inverse relationship between the effectiveness of a policy and the level of uncertainty in the economy. Using high frequency daily data from the Federal funds futures market, we first estimate the response of S&P 500 stock returns to monetary policy surprises within the time varying parameter (TVP) model. We then analyze the relationship of these time varying estimates with the benchmark VIX index and alternative measures of uncertainty. Evidence suggests a significant negative relationship between the level of uncertainty and the time varying response of S&P 500 stock returns to unanticipated changes in the interest rate. Thus, at higher levels of uncertainty the impact of monetary policy shocks on stock markets is lower. The results are robust to different measures of uncertainty.",

Results indicate that both dark and lit market fragmentation increase around earnings announcements. Further, I test whether dark and lit fragmentation hinder the level of price discovery around the earnings announcement, resulting in greater post-earnings announcement drift, PEAD. The analysis reveals that lit fragmentation has no significant impact on PEAD while dark fragmentation reduces the level of PEAD for stocks with positive earnings surprises. This result is consistent with the notion that dark venues capture more uninformed trading around positive news events, resulting in greater informed trading and higher informational efficiency in the lit venue. However, the results also indicate that dark fragmentation leads to stronger PEAD for stocks with negative earnings surprises. This last finding suggests that informed traders migrate to dark venues around negative earnings surprises, consistent with previous research that argues informed traders follow passive trading strategies around negative news events.",

        "abstract": "There are two main questions that have attracted considerable attention in the financial literature over the last few years: whether international diversification benefits are still substantial in the current context of increasing market correlations and which approach provides better results in terms of out-of-sample returns and risk. In this context, the aim of this study is to provide empirical evidence about the economic gains that a US investor could obtain with a dynamic strategy based on the use of time varying returns and volatility forecasts from a multivariate VAR\u00e2\u0080\u0093DCC approach for the exchange trade funds of US, UK and Japan which are the most actively traded on the New York Stock Exchange in recent years. These findings are relevant not only for academics, but also for practitioners, especially for professional portfolio managers.",

We show that high premium stocks experience the highest levels of imputed small investor buying, suggesting that the premium is driven by buying by small investors when the announcement catches their attention.",

A replicating portfolio of connected stocks outperforms a replicating portfolio of non-connected stocks by up to 8.4% per year.

Treasury bonds are almost always overvalued relative to TIPS. Total TIPS-Treasury mispricing has exceeded $56 billion, representing nearly eight percent of the total amount of TIPS outstanding. TIPS-Treasury mispricing is strongly related to supply factors such as Treasury debt issuance and the availability of collateral in the financial markets, and is correlated with other types of fixed-income arbitrages, These results pose a major puzzle to classical asset pricing theory. In addition, they raise the issue of why the Treasury issues TIPS, since in so doing it both gives up a valuable fiscal hedging option and leaves large amounts of money on the table.",

This article analyses the information content of the Bund Future and German government bonds during 1998 and test whether it is constant over time. The use of high-frequency data permits us to capture possible imperfections in the information flows between the two markets. We measure the contributions of trading on the spot and futures markets to price discovery using the information shares approach by Hasbrouck (1995) as well as a recently proposed approach based on the Gonzalo-Granger decomposition. A state-space approach is used to estimate the underlying VECM in the presence of missing values. We test for structural breaks in the pricing relationship between the spot and futures markets and estimate break dates. Although most information is incorporated into prices in the futures market, this does not mean that the spot market is irrelevant for prices discovery. Under normal market conditions, the underlying bonds contribute to 19 to 33 % of the variation in the efficient price. The informational role of the spot market vanishes during episodes of stress. For example, during the two weeks after the recapitalization of LTCM (September 24th to October 8th, 1998), the information share of the spot market dropped to virtually zero and futures prices did not respond to movements in bond prices. All adjustment towards equilibrium took place in the spot market.",

Using a formal cojumping test this paper considers the cojumping behavior of spot and futures prices in high frequency US Treasury data. Cojumping occurs most frequently at shorter maturities and higher sampling frequencies. We find that the presence of an anticipated macroeconomic news announcement, and particularly non-farm payrolls, increases the probability of observing cojumps. However, a negative surprise in non-farm payrolls, also increases the probability of the cojumping tests being unable to determine whether jumps in spots and futures occur contemporaneously, or alternatively that one market follows the other. On these occasions the market does not clearly signal its short term pricing behavior.",

This reduction is stronger in case of high impact news and on days with high volatility. In addition, we assess the effect of algorithmic trading on market quality around macroeconomic news.

The increase in the availability of financial news and investor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ease of access to it has a potentially significant impact on market price formation as these news items are swiftly transformed into investors sentiment which in turn drives prices. Various commercial agencies have started developing their own financial news data sets which are used by investors and traders to support their algorithmic trading strategies. Thomson Reuters News Analytics (TRNA)1 is one such data set. In this study we use the TRNA data set to construct a series of daily sentiment scores for Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) stock index component companies. We use these daily DJIA market sentiment scores to study the influence of financial news sentiment scores on the stock prices of these companies using a multi-factor model. We use an augmented Fama French Three Factor Model to evaluate the additional effects of financial news sentiment on stock prices in the context of this model. Our results suggest that even when market factors are taken into account, sentiment scores have a significant effect on Dow Jones constituent company returns and that lagged daily sentiment scores are often significant, suggesting that information compounded in these scores is not immediately reflected in security prices and related return series.",

We construct a new four-fold beta decomposition, distinguishing cash flow and discount rate betas in up and down markets. Using CRSP data over 1963--2008, we find that the downside cash flow beta and downside discount rate beta carry the largest premia. We subject our result to an extensive number of robustness checks. Overall, downside cash flow risk is priced most consistently across different samples, periods, and return decomposition methods, and is the only component of beta that has significant out-of-sample predictive ability. The downside cash flow risk premium is mainly attributable to small stocks. The risk premium for large stocks appears much more driven by a compensation for symmetric, cash flow related risk. Finally, we multiply our premia estimates by average betas to compute the contribution of the different risk components to realized average returns. We find that up and down discount rate components dominate the contribution to average returns of downside cash flow risk.",

We analyze quarterly data for S&P500 constituents from 2010 to 2020, using Google search volume index and media coverage as a proxy for information demand and supply, respectively. Our results show that higher information demand lowers stock price synchronicity, as greater interest in a firm exposes more firm-specific information. We also find a negative association between media coverage and stock price synchronicity, implying that media coverage helps stock prices better reflect firm-specific information. The tone of news further moderates this negative effect. However, our analysis does not confirm a stronger negative relationship between media coverage and stock price synchronicity for firms with more opaque information environments. Overall, our study offers new insights into the impact of information flow on stock price synchronicity, benefiting investors and policy makers in portfolio allocation and financial market monitoring.",

In this way firm value is \\anchored\" to the stock price, confirming the existence of anchoring effects in financial markets beyond the boundaries of the experimental lab. Interestingly, firms with a high nominal share price at the end of the year, tend to have lower returns in the subsequent year.

Significant abnormal returns indicate that the output decisions are informationally important for the pricing of crude oil transportation services. We consistently find patterns of positive abnormal returns around production increase announcements and negative abnormal returns around announcements of production cuts. Our analysis also suggests that market participants appear to trade three to five days prior to the final announcement based on their anticipation of the actual output announcements. This is consistent with findings from related studies on crude oil returns.

On average across these countries, a one percentage point surprise rise in official interest rates leads to a 1% appreciation of the exchange rate and a 1% fall in stock market indices. The effect on exchange rates is notably weaker in the non-Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries with a managed float. For the OECD countries, there is no robust evidence of a change in the effect of policy during the global financial crisis. For the non-OECD countries, there is some evidence of a stronger effect of policy on stock markets during the crisis, although further research is needed to investigate whether this is a result of measurement issues.",

We present an applied study of the profitability and the impact on market quality of an individual high-frequency trader acting as a market-maker. Using a sample of sixty stocks over a six-month period, we implement the optimal quoting policy (OQP) of liquidity provision from Ait-Sahalia and Saglam's (2014) dynamic inventory management model. The OQP allows the high-frequency trader to extract a constant annuity from the market but its profitability is insufficient to cover the costs of market-making activities. The OQP is embedded in a trading strategy that relaxes the model\u00e2\u0080\u0099s constraint on the quantity traded. Circuit-breakers are implemented and market imperfections are considered. Profits excluding maker-fees and considering transaction fees are economically significant. We propose a methodology to adjust the returns for asynchronous trading and varying leverage levels associated with dynamic inventory management. This allows us to qualify high trade volume as a proxy of informed trading. The high-frequency trader behaves as a constant liquidity provider and has a positive effect on market quality even in periods of market stress.",

A long-only portfolio of stocks with the highest RNS values yields significant positive alpha in the post-ranking week during the period 1996-2014. This outperformance is mainly driven by stocks that are relatively underpriced but are also exposed to greater downside risk. These findings are consistent with a trading mechanism where investors choose to exploit perceived stock underpricing via OTM options due to their embedded leverage, rather than directly buying the underlying stock to avoid exposure to its potential downside. Due to the absence of severe limits-to-arbitrage for the long-side, the price correction signalled by RNS is very quick, typically overnight.",

We find that the system shows periodic, quasi-periodic and chaotic dynamics as well as synchronization between technical traders.

In particular, we focus on estimating and forecasting a nonlinear exponential smooth autoregressive model (ESTAR). One motivation for nonlinearity in asset markets is the presence of transaction costs, which result in a nonlinear adjustment process towards equilibrium through arbitrage. Using a novel approach that allows for the joint testing of nonlinearity and nonstationarity, we are able to reject the null hypothesis of linearity and that of a nonlinear unit root. We also find evidence of a nonlinear cointegrating relationship between stock prices and dividends where the error correction term follows a globally stationary ESTAR process. This evidence together with nonlinear impulse response functions, which show that large deviations have faster speeds of mean reversion than small deviations indicates that while stock prices may reflect their fundamentals in the long run, they may deviate substantially from their fundamentals for periods of time. Using an ESTAR-EGARCH model of the dividend-price ratio we find empirical support for in-sample and out-of-sample long-horizon predictability, and we explain why it is often difficult to exploit this predictability using real-time forecasts.",

This phenomenon is particularly evident for small-capitalization stocks. We then propose a theoretical model to estimate long-horizon co-skewness using data observed at the shortest horizon, which emphasizes the role of adjustment delays in the pricing of market-wide information among securities. Co-skewness is only found to be priced in the cross-section of stock returns for a small range of short horizons, calling into question the universal validity of the three-moment model.",

Our results indicate that the ETF 52 index has the greatest volatility as well as the most negative returns, whilst also suggesting the existence of at least five cointegrating vectors among the variables; thus, through the concept of cointegration, we demonstrate that vectors will not arbitrarily wander far from each other in long-run relationships. We also examine Granger (1980) causality in the relationships between the variables and find that the guiding relationship exists within the spot index, with stronger indications of the spot index leading the ETF indices. Among the six time-series variables, depending on the decomposition of the forecast residual variance, the spot index is the least affected by external forces. Furthermore, the spot index is affected mainly by its own shocks, and less so by those of the other time-series variables. Although the spot index variance decomposition can identify all but its own excess shocks, none of the indices can consistently trace out the effects of one-unit impulses.",

We find that, after accounting for several technical factors, the measure changes over time in coincidence with well-known events that affected the corporate market in the past several years. In addition, several macroeconomic and financial variables appear to account for a substantial part of the changes in corporate market frictions over time. We also conduct an event-study type of analysis to relate our measure to monetary-policy-related events, such as changes in the target federal funds rate, speeches by Federal Reserve officials, and data releases that are closely followed by FOMC observers, such as the monthly employment reports and CPI releases",

Our approach to test the Monday effect is based on spatial dominance, which enables us to analyze the expected sum of instantaneous utilities during trading hours by considering the intraday patterns of returns. The testing of the methods used in previous studies compares the expected utilities only at a specific time, usually market closing time. Empirical results from our tests provide strong evidence of the Monday effect for the 1983 to 1987 period. We also find that the Monday effect is driven by large negative returns accrued during early Monday mornings, The conventional analyses for the Monday effect, such as regression analysis and stochastic dominance, cannot provide strong evidence of the Monday effect for the same period because these testing methods do not consider the return behavior during Monday mornings.",

Our results are consistent with the thesis that the equity bond relation is dependent on the potential wealth transfer between stock and debt holders. Nevertheless, this relation seems to break down during periods of extreme market uncertainty.",

The new proxy is an easy-to-construct, real time measure available at different frequencies for more than a century. Empirically I find that negative skewness is most pronounced when investors have experienced high sentiment. The role of differences of opinion depends on the states of average investor sentiment: it positively forecasts market skewness in an optimistic state, but negatively forecasts it in a pessimistic state. Conceptually, I provide an explanation for the role of differences of opinion based on the theory of Abreu and Brunnermeier (2003). I argue that convergence of opinion in an optimistic state indicates that the price run-up is unlikely to be sustained since fewer investors can remain net buyers in the future. Therefore rational arbitrageurs coordinate their attack on the bubble, leading to a market crash. Vice versa, the convergence of opinion in a pessimistic state promotes coordinated purchases among rational arbitrageurs, leading to a strong recovery.",

We implement an asset-allocation strategy incorporating asymmetric dependence and price range information to explore their economic importance. The out-of-sample results show that between 35 and 517 basis points and between 90 and 1111 basis points are earned annually when acknowledging asymmetric dependence and price range information, respectively.

We define a kernel-weighted pre-averaging method to jointly tackle the microstructure noise and asynchronicity issues, and we obtain uniformly consistent estimates for latent prices. We impose a continuous-time factor model with time-varying factor loadings on the price processes, and estimate the common factors and loadings via a local principal component analysis. Assuming a uniform sparsity condition on the idiosyncratic volatility structure, we combine the POET and kernel-smoothing techniques to estimate the spot volatility matrices for both the latent prices and idiosyncratic errors. Under some mild restrictions, the estimated spot volatility matrices are shown to be uniformly consistent under various matrix norms.

Using a variety of predictor variables from the literature on predictability of stock returns, we find that theoretical constraints have an important effect on the coefficient estimates and can significantly reduce biases and estimation errors in these.

We design an asset market where information arrives sequentially over time and is revealed asymmetrically to investors. None of the three hypotheses is supported by our data: (1) Investors do not respond differently to public information and private information, and they do not behave in ways that are claimed by multiple psychological models; (2) no groups of investors are identified to drive under- or over-reaction in particular; (3) price deviation from expected payoff cannot be justified by risk metrics. We find that prices react insufficiently to news surprises, possibly because of cautious conservatism on the part of investors and under-reacting drifts outnumber overreacting reversals substantially. Contrary to common beliefs, we find that over-reaction is caused by slow adjustment of prices to surprises, similar to the cause of under-reaction. It is the degree of price inertia that drives the relative frequencies of under- and over-reaction. We propose a simple price inertia theory of under- and over-reaction: when information arrives sequentially over time, the market is characterized by a slow convergence toward intrinsic value; when news surprises are of the same signs, prices falls behind newly updated intrinsic values, manifesting under-reacting drifts; when news surprises change signs, prices again do not adjust quick enough to catch up with the new intrinsic values, manifesting a temporal pattern of overreacting reversals.",

        "abstract": "In general, the yield spread between long- and short-term bonds contains useful information for future economic activity and inflation. Particularly, it usually reflects market participants' expectations of future monetary policy and credit demand. However, it is becoming increasingly difficult to extract such information from the yield spread of government bonds in the US because of the impact of the so-called \"flight to quality\" where investors seek refuge in risk-free government bonds during a financial crisis, and also because of a reduction in the new issue of such bonds. This paper examines the power of the yield spread of corporate bonds as a substitute for government bonds in predicting economic activity. From empirical studies, we find that the yield spread of corporate bonds is a more effective predictor than government bonds for economic activity. Since the mid-1990s, the US fiscal balance has rapidly improved. As a result, the risk premium stemming from accumulating public debt has decreased, leading to the structural narrowing of the yield spread. After excluding the impact of the improved fiscal situation, we find that the yield spreads of both corporate and government bonds provide more useful information for future economic activity. Considering the relatively stable credit risk premium observed in corporate bond yields, more attention should be paid to the information contained in the yield spread of corporate bonds for future economic activity. Our estimation indicate that the current level of yield spread of corporate bonds predicts the strong continuous expansion of the U.S. economy extending into the near future.",

Employing an event-study analysis with a high-frequency instrumental variable estimator, we find that the trading volume of our sample of commodity futures declines following FOMC announcements. Further, we find that more traded commodities are also more exposed to monetary policy surprises, suggesting a significant role for trading activity in the transmission of monetary policy shocks to commodity markets. Lastly, we show that the direction of the target rate change matters to this transmission mechanism of monetary policy.",

The first strategy is based on moving average trading rules and the second strategy, Gold Momentum Strategy (GMS), is based on switching between gold and PSI-20 based on semi-annual performance. Our findings suggest that the moving average trading rules beat the buy and hold strategy by more than 10% per year over the entire period and each sub-period considering both risk and transaction costs. For the second strategy, GMS which is based on comparing the performance of the PSI-20 and the gold index on semi-annual basis and go with the best of two for the next 6 months, we find similar results as the moving average trading rules.",

Central banks\u00e2\u0080\u0099 transparency is in most respects much greater than it was a decade ago, and so central bank communication needs to be included as a potential source of news. We therefore consider four types of news: macroeconomic news, overseas news, monetary policy surprises and central bank communication. The effect of these types of news on daily changes in interest rate futures is estimated using an EGARCH model for a panel of six economies. We find that interest rate expectations respond to both macroeconomic and policy news, although the response to macroeconomic news is larger, especially once we include foreign news. Overall, the results suggest that the impact of the RBA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s communication policy is in line with other major central banks, and significantly influences (and informs) expectations of future monetary policy.",

        "abstract": "Abstract The efficient market hypothesis is highly discussed in economic literature. In its strongest form, it states that there are no price trends. When weakening the non-trending assumption to arbitrary short, small, and fully unknown trends, we mathematically prove for a specific class of control-based trading strategies positive expected gains. These strategies are model free, i.e., a trader neither has to think about predictable patterns nor has to estimate market parameters such as the trend\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sign like momentum traders have to do. That means, since the trader does not have to know any trend, even trends too small to find are enough to beat the market. Adjustments for risk and comparisons with buy-and-hold strategies do not satisfactorily solve the problem. In detail, we generalize results from the literature on control-based trading strategies to market settings without specific model assumptions, but with time-varying parameters in discrete and continuous time. We give closed-form formulae for the expected gain as well as the gain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s variance and generalize control-based trading rules to a setting where older information counts less. In addition, we perform an exemplary backtesting study taking transaction costs and bid-ask spreads into account and still observe\u00e2\u0080\u0094on average\u00e2\u0080\u0094positive gains.",

We combine straightforward comparison measurements with cointegration analysis to test for the accuracy and efficiency of the FFA projections. We find that FFAs display limited usefulness in predicting future freights, only slightly superior than simple naive models. The shorter the contract period and the smaller the vessel the better the forecast.

We show that positive statements indicating that a Grexit is less likely lead to higher returns, and negative statements to lower returns. The overall impact of negative statements is more pronounced.

The results show that all sectoral returns have greater persistence during the COVID-19 outbreak than during the GFC.

Lastly, the fat-tailed distribution has a greater effect on multifractality in these industries.

This relation is mostly driven by the systematic component of volume. In contrast, for small stocks the evidence matches the predictions of standard adverse selection models. In line with a continuous-time inventory model, we show that the volatility of order imbalances can reconcile our puzzling finding with standard intuition. Order imbalance volatility is strongly associated with spreads both in the time series and cross-section. Evidence from alternative liquidity measures (price impact and depth), spread decomposition, and intraday patterns support our interpretation of order imbalance volatility as a measure of inventory risk.

        "abstract": "This paper investigates whether news suggestive of irrationality within financial markets have an impact on stock returns. We construct a lexicon of words for 'market irrationality' and score daily news articles based on the number and proportion of words they contain from the lexicon. We find that reported market irrationality has a significant negative impact on subsequent stock market returns and exacerbates stock market volatility. Furthermore, stocks with large, negative irrationality risk betas outperform stocks with large, positive betas on average by 10.3% annually. Accounting for the Fama-French factors, this results in an alpha of 8.6% annually, which is significant at the 1% level. These results suggest that a large, positive IRR beta amplifies a stock's reaction to market irrationality while a large, negative IRR beta dampens it. The subsequent IRR betas' mean-reversion is consistent with this conjecture.",

        "abstract": "Using data for the 1978-2008 period, this study presents evidence for cointegration between securitized (NAREIT) and direct (NCREIF) total return indices. Cointegration between the indices indicates that REITs and direct real estate are substitutable in the portfolio of a long-horizon buy-and-hold investor. Since the real estate indices are not found to be cointegrated with the stock market, REITs and direct real estate are likely to have similar long-term diversification benefits in a stock portfolio. In line with prior expectations, only direct real estate is found to currently adjust towards the cointegrating relation, with NAREIT returns leading NCREIF returns. However, giving support to the often stated argument regarding weaker informational efficiency of the REIT market prior to the \u00e2\u0080\u009cnew REIT era\u00e2\u0080\u009d, the results show evidence for the predictability of NAREIT returns during the 1980s. It is also found that at the beginning of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cnew REIT era\u00e2\u0080\u009d a large and long-lasting deviation from the long-run relation between NAREIT and NCREIF emerged.

We take the ratio of these two probabilities in order to describe the shape of the state price density and to evaluate its consistency with economic theory. We find that using a large dataset and introducing non-Gaussian innovations, the pricing kernel puzzle that arises in Jackwerth (2000) disappears both in a single day and over an average of different days with options expiring at the same maturity.

To address this limitation, we propose a Generalized Portfolio Sorts (GPS) model, which can exactly replicate results from all variants of conventional portfolio sorts, but can also be specified so that it separates a firm characteristic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s genuine predictive power from stable firm-level factors. We also derive a statistical test to detect whether return predictability arises from the sorting characteristic itself or from persistent, firm-level traits. Applied to a large set of proposed asset pricing predictors, we find that nearly half lose significance once persistent, firm-level heterogeneity is accounted for. The GPS-model thus strengthens factor validation, advances our understanding of the factor zoo, and provides a more robust foundation for empirical asset pricing tests.",

Besides, our method handles multivariate firm characteristics and, if firm fixed effects are included, is robust to misattributing cross-sectional return predictability.

        "abstract": "We study the interdependence of FX and Treasury Bonds (TES) markets in Colombia. To do this, we estimate a heteroskedasticity identified VAR model on the returns of the COP/USD exchange rate (TRM) and bond prices, as well as event-analysis models for return volatilities, number of quotes, quote volume, and bid/ask spreads. The data under analysis consists of 5-minute intraday bid/ask US dollar prices and bond quotes, for an assortment of bond species. For these species we also have the number of bid/ask quotes as well as their volume. We found, also, that the exchange rate conveys information to the TES market, but the opposite does not completely hold: A one percent COP depreciation leads to a persistent reduction of TES prices between 0.05% and 0.22%. However, a 1% TES price increase has a very small effect and not entirely significant on the exchange rate, i.e. a COP appreciation between 0.001% and 0.009%. Furthermore, TRM return volatility increases do not affect bond return volatility but its liquidity, i.e. the bid/ask quote number and volume. These results are coherent with the fact that the FX market more efficiently reflects the effect of shocks than the TES market, which may be due to its low liquidity and concentration on a specific habitat. These results have implications for the design of financial stability policies as well as for private portfolio design, rebalancing and hedging. **** RESUMEN: Analizamos la interdependencia entre los mercados de divisas y bonos (TES) en Colombia.

Sin embargo, un incremento de 1% del precio de los bonos tiene un efecto peque\u00c3\u00b1o y no enteramente significativo sobre la TRM, i.e. una apreciaci\u00c3\u00b3n del peso entre 0.001% y 0.009%. Adicionalmente, los incrementos en la volatilidad de la TRM no afectan la volatilidad de los retornos de los bonos, pero si su liquidez, es decir, el n\u00c3\u00bamero y volumen de sus ofertas. Estos resultados son consistentes con el hecho de que el mercado de divisas refleja de manera m\u00c3\u00a1s eficiente el efecto de los choques que el de bonos, resultado de la baja liquidez y concentraci\u00c3\u00b3n en un h\u00c3\u00a1bitat espec\u00c3\u00adfico de este \u00c3\u00baltimo.

Hence they face a trade-off between trading fast on a signal (i.e., before processing it), at the risk of trading on a false news, or trading after processing the signal, at the risk that prices already reflect their information. The number of speculators who choose to trade fast increases with news reliability and decreases with the cost of fast trading technologies. We derive testable implications for the effects of these variables on (i) the value of information, (ii) patterns in returns and trades, (iii) the frequency of price reversals in a stock, and (iv) informational efficiency. Cheaper fast trading technologies simultaneously raise informational efficiency and the frequency of ``mini-flash crashes\": large price movements that revert quickly.",

        "abstract": "This paper looks into the sovereign credit default swap (CDS) market from two perspectives. First, it analyses the relation between CDS and bond spreads. The results on a single-entity basis suggest that the CDS market leads the bond market in price discovery, especially during 2010, while both markets contribute during the pre-Lehman period and in 2009. Moreover, the inclusion of the EURIBOR-EUREPO 3-month spread helps to restore the long-run relation after the Lehman bailout. An event-study, which compares the reaction of sovereign CDS and bond markets to policy announcements in Europe, suggests that both markets react in the same way, especially after the release of bad news. As for the relation between prices and volumes of sovereign CDSs, estimates do not point to any stable relation. The second perspective is the relation between CDS spreads for sovereign and corporate entities. Our estimates on an aggregate and sector-wide basis point to a leading property of the former sector, even in 2009, while the banking sector increases its leading power during 2010.",

They showed that shocks to interest rate differentials lead to carry trade activity and to significant reactions in the bilateral exchange rates vis-a-vis the US dollar that they analyse. Starting from their paper, we take a more macroeconomic standpoint and aim to identify what kind of structural shock can generate the implications of their interest rate differential shock. To this aim we add two macroeconomic variables and two indicators of confidence to the 4-variable financial VAR of Brunnermeier et al. (2009) and use sign restrictions on the impulse responses of the resulting larger VAR to identify four macroeconomic shocks. We evidence that demand shocks and confidence shocks are associated with longer-term gains from carry trade activity, relative to supply and monetary policy shocks. This finding also supports the widely reported idea that sentiment boosts position taking.",

This creates a permanent risk of financial fragmentation within the area. In this paper we claim that political decisions that signal commitment to safeguarding the adequate functioning of the euro area influence investors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 valuations. We focus on decisions conducive to enhancing the institutional framework of the euro area (\u00e2\u0080\u009cEMU deepening\u00e2\u0080\u009d). To test our hypothesis we build a comprehensive narrative of events (decisions) from all documents and press releases issued by the Council of the EU and the European Council during the period January 2010 to March 2020. We categorize the events as dealing with: (i) economic and financial integration; (ii) fiscal policy; (iii) bailouts. With our extremely rich narrative at hand, we conduct event-study regressions with daily data to assess the impact of events on sovereign bond yields and find that indeed decisions on financial integration drive down periphery spreads. Moreover, while decisions on key subjects present a robust effect, this is not the case with prior discussions on those subjects at the Council level. Finally, we show that the impacts arise from reductions in peripheral sovereign spreads, and not by the opposite movement in core countries. We conclude that EU policy-makers have at their disposal signicant \u00e2\u0080\u009cpolitical space\u00e2\u0080\u009d to reduce fragmentation and gain \u00e2\u0080\u009cpolicy space\u00e2\u0080\u009d.",

Based on daily data, the growth of the Eurex market seems to support the tightening of the bid-ask spread of MTS Cash, all things being equal, thus confirming a healthy and efficient link between cash and futures markets. Against this backdrop, a high frequency analysis highlights some episodes of partial divergence between price developments of futures and cash markets, which might be related to differences in the microstructures of the two markets. The futures market is order driven while the cash market is quote driven; furthermore different types of participants are active in each market. At higher frequencies, episodes of unidirectional propagation of volatility shocks from BTP futures to the MTS Cash market materialize, with potential spillovers on cash market liquidity conditions. In this regard, it is also important to consider the role played by High Frequency Traders, whose activity in futures markets may well contribute to explaining the peculiarities in price dynamics highlighted by high frequency data.",

Such processes are used in the preopening period of continuous trading systems in several exchanges. It is found that the insider manipulates the market using a contrarian strategy in order to neutralize the effect of the trades of competitive informed agents. Furthermore, consistently with the empirical evidence available, we find that information revelation accelerates close to the opening, that the market price does not converge to the fundamental value no matter how many rounds the tatonnement has, and that the expected trading volume displays a U-shaped pattern. We also find that a market with a larger competitive sector (smaller insider) has an improved informational efficiency and an increased trading volume. The insider provides a public good (a lower informativeness of the price) for the competitive informed sector.",

During the financial crisis of 1997 the prevailing links among monetary variables tended to gain strength. The mutual links among interest rates provide clear proof that during the crisis the money market had became more efficient than at any time before. This was possible partially because of emerged arbitrage opportunities. The linkages show that turbulence and uncertainty enabled interest rates to again become the price of money as well as to influence the exchange rate.

This study analyzes the Brazilian stock loan market, disentangling the shorting demand and supply curve shifts to understand the driving mechanism linking the supply side and stock returns.

By analyzing the KOSPI 200 options intraday data, we find that the abnormal implied volatility significantly increases around announcements of macroeconomic news and that the extent of the response is influenced by a variety of factors, including the type of macroeconomic indicators released, option type and economic conditions. Specifically, the increase in implied volatility around these announcements is more pronounced for puts than for calls. These effects are also more pronounced in the crisis and post-crisis periods than in the pre-crisis period. Monetary policy announcements have a more substantial impact on implied volatility than other announcements, even after controlling for news surprise components.

        "abstract": "We propose a theory that jointly accounts for an asset illiquidity and for the asset price potential over-reliance on public information. We argue that, when trading frequencies differ across traders, asset prices reflect investors' Higher Order Expectations (HOEs) about the two factors that influence the aggregate demand: fundamentals information and liquidity trades. We show that it is precisely when asset prices are driven by investors' HOEs about fundamentals that they over-rely on public information, the market displays high illiquidity, and low volume of informational trading; conversely, when HOEs about fundamentals are subdued, prices under-rely on public information, the market hovers in a high liquidity state, and the volume of informational trading is high. Over-reliance on public information results from investors' under-reaction to their private signals which, in turn, dampens uncertainty reduction over liquidation prices, favoring an increase in price risk and illiquidity. Therefore, a highly illiquid market implies higher expected returns from contrarian strategies. Equivalently, illiquidity arises as a byproduct of the lack of participation of informed investors in their capacity of liquidity suppliers, a feature that appears to capture some aspects of the recent crisis.",

Using a formal cojumping test this paper considers the cojumping behavior of spot and futures prices in high frequency US Treasury data. Cojumping occurs most frequently at shorter maturities and higher sampling frequencies. We find that the presence of an anticipated macroeconomic news announcement, and particularly non-farm payrolls, increases the probability of observing cojumps. However, a negative surprise in non-farm payrolls, also increases the probability of the cojumping tests being unable to determine whether jumps in spots and futures occur contemporaneously, or alternatively that one market follows the other.

Using tests that identify the intra-day timing of jumps, we show that before the adjustment, jumps in the financial market have high probability of occurring concurrently with pre-scheduled economy-wide news announcements. We demonstrate that adjustment for the U-shaped volatility pattern prior to jump detection effectively removes most of the association between jumps and macroeconomic news announcements. We find empirical evidence that only news that comes with large surprise can cause jumps in the market index after the volatility adjustment, while the effect of other types of news is largely absorbed through the continuous volatility channel. The FOMC meeting announcement is shown to have the highest association with jumps in the market both before and after the adjustment.",

Jumps have short-term positive impact on market activity and illiquidity and see a persistent change in the price.",

Moreover, while limit orders have smaller price impact, their greater variation contributes more to the variance of price updates. Lastly, we find increased price impact of trades and especially limit orders following major announcements (such as FOMC rate decisions and macroeconomic data releases), suggesting that the private information derived from public information is disproportionally exploited through limit orders.",

By treating macroeconomic variables as external factors to financial market volatility, our study distinguishes between internal financial volatility spillovers and external shocks arising from macroeconomic changes. Our analysis reveals that without macroeconomic shocks, the Stock market predominantly acts as the main source of volatility spillovers, with Crude Oil being the principal spillover recipient. However, the Stock market\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s role in driving volatility spillover, especially towards the Crude Oil market, changes markedly in the context of macroeconomic shocks. These shocks exert a more substantial impact on Crude Oil compared to other markets. In contrast, the Bond and Gold markets exhibit a lower level of volatility transmission and are less influenced by macroeconomic shocks, thereby reinforcing their roles as stabilizers within the financial system.",

The results show that the Shanghai A-share stock index has significant negative autocorrelations in the lower regime and has significant positive autocorrelations in the higher regime. It attributes that Chinese investors overreact and underreact in two different states. These results are similar when we employ individual stocks. Besides, we investigate stock return autocorrelations by different stock characteristics, including liquidity, volatility, market to book ratio and investor sentiment. The results show autocorrelations are significantly large in the middle and higher regimes of market to book ratio and volatility. Psychological biases can result into return autocorrelations by using investor sentiment proxy since autocorrelations are significantly larger in the middle and higher regime of investor sentiment.

In this paper, we propose a multiplicative error model (MEM) for the dynamics of illiquidity. We empirically study the illiquidity and volatility spillover effects in eight developed equity markets during and after the recent financial crisis. The results indicate that equity markets are interdependent, both in terms of volatility and illiquidity. Most markets show an increase in volatility and illiquidity spillover effects during the crisis. Furthermore, we find volatility and illiquidity transmission are highly relevant. Illiquidity is a more important channel than volatility in propagating the shocks in equity markets. Our results show an overall crucial role for illiquidity in the US market in influencing other equity markets illiquidity and volatility. These findings are of importance for policy makers as well as institutional and private investors.",

After this bias is corrected, the literature shows that with higher trading volume, returns decline in both effects in the contemporaneous and even in the dynamic one. Second, one cannot rely on any general conclusions about stock markets. The predictability of stock returns varies with different markets and stock types. Third, different data characteristics, structural variations and methodologies used drive the heterogeneity in the results of the primary articles.

Fundamentalists rely on their model employing fundamental information basis to forecast the next price period. Chartists determine whether current conditions call for the acquisition of fundamental information in a forward looking manner rather than relying on the past performance. It was shown that implementation of the agents memory can significantly change the preferences of trader strategies. The Worst out Algorithm (WOA) is used with considered heterogeneous agents\u00e2\u0080\u0099 model to simulate more realistic market conditions. The WOA replaces periodically the trading strategy that has the lowest performance level of all strategies presented on the market by the new one. The memory length of the new strategy that enters the market has the same stochastic structure as the initial strategies. This paper shows an influence of the agent memory as a stochastic process on the heterogeneous agents model with the WOA. Simulations show difference in price returns behaviour between two types of agents\u00e2\u0080\u0099 memory length distribution functions (Uniform and Normal). There is a significant difference in the values of the Hurst exponent and the variance in these two cases. A lower Hurst exponent in the uniform case is caused by a richer spectrum of agents\u00e2\u0080\u0099 memory length, because agents are equally distributed across all trading horizons. For the uniform case there is no opportunity for any prediction. On the other hand, the value of the Hurst exponent gives a signal for a possibility of the price prediction in the normal case.",

We define a kernel-weighted pre-averaging method to jointly tackle the microstructure noise and asynchronicity issues, and we obtain uniformly consistent estimates for latent prices. We impose a continuous-time factor model with time-varying factor loadings on the price processes, and estimate the common factors and loadings via a local principal component analysis. Assuming a uniform sparsity condition on the idiosyncratic volatility structure, we combine the POET and kernel-smoothing techniques to estimate the spot volatility matrices for both the latent prices and idiosyncratic errors. Under some mild restrictions, the estimated spot volatility matrices are shown to be uniformly consistent under various matrix norms.

Further looking at sub-samples over the pre-Great Recession period reveals that parameter instability in terms of absolute and relative size of yields response to news, as well as significance, is present. The often cited dominance to markets of the employment report has been evolving over time, as the size of the yields reaction to it was steadily increasing. Over the most recent crisis period, however, there has been an overall switch in the relative importance of soft and hard data compared to the pre-crisis period, with the later becoming more important even if less timely.

        "abstract": "In this paper, we examine whether the currency carry trade hypothesis can consistently explain the forward premium bias (anomaly) across different regimes of interest rates differentials. To investigate this, we consider a nonlinear extension of the forward premium regression allowing for interest rates differentials threshold effects. Using the US dollar as home currency, we provide clear-cut evidence that the currency carry trade hypothesis can offer an explanation of the forward premium anomaly only when interest rates differentials are positive. When they are negative, or close to zero, the hypothesis fails to explain the forward premium anomaly. We show that the negative interest rates differentials regime covers periods of financial crises and distressed market conditions which may lead investors to seek safe-haven currencies and thus, adopt anti-carry trade strategies.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this paper is to model differential rates over residual information sets, so as to shape transactional algebras into operational grounds. Firstly, simple differential rates over residual information sets are introduced by taking advantage of finite algebras of sets. Secondly, after contextual sets and the relevant algebra of information sets is suitably fashioned, generalized differential rates over residual information sets are expanded on, while a recursive algorithm is set forth to characterize such rates and sets. Thirdly, the notion of transactional algebra is presented and heed is given to the costs of running such structure. Finally, an application to financial arbitrage processes is fully developed within a transactional algebra, setting up arbitrage returns net of transaction costs, establishing boundary conditions for an arbitrage to take place, and finally allowing for a definition of what should be meant by financial arbitrage within a transactional algebra.",

By the same token, similar shortcoming prevent the standard financial arbitrage model from being functional to real markets environments. To overcome such drawbacks, this paper sets forth a new approach that is grounded on transactional algebras, which shapes the arbitrage gaps of return within institutional settings, to give account of market microstructure features and enlarged transaction costs.",

Accordingly, it has been attempted to assess if investors can receive abnormal returns in accordance with the recommendations of brokerage houses using the case study technique. The validity of the semi-strong effective form of investors who made a buying-selling decision based on brokerage house recommendations was investigated. The returns of the banks' stocks were obtained from the data-stream database. The study evaluated buy-sell recommendations for four large brokerage houses and analyzed data from January 2018 through December 2020. The event study method was used, and t-test was performed in order to determine the difference of abnormal returns from zero in the research. As a result of the research, a negative abnormal return was determined on the day of the event and the day after the sell recommendation was given. Besides, a positive abnormal return was determined on the day before the announcement and on the day of the event in the bank stocks on which buy recommendation has been given. In this respect, the average abnormal and cumulative abnormal returns indicated that BIST was not an efficient market in a semi-strong form for the banking sector. When the sell recommendations and their effects are examined within the scope of the research, it is seen that the day before [-1] p=0.016 value was obtained, on the day, [0] p=0.018 value was obtained, the next day and two days later [+1, +2] p=0.077 and 0.046 values were obtained. On the other hand, when the buy recommendations and their effects are examined, it is seen that the day before [-1] p=0.000 and on the day [0] p=0.098 values were obtained. T-test results and p values show that brokerage house recommendations are effective on stock returns in the BIST banking sector, and therefore BIST banking sector is effective in a weak form. The obtained results of the study were crucial for investors who invested in short-term stocks.",

AH52 subsumes the predictive power of well-documented market state variables such as market illiquidity, market volatility, and down market state.

In this paper, we analyze whether the information contained in past intraday and overnight returns affects future stock returns in different ways. Specifically, we propose that investors tend to underreact to intraday information while overreact to overnight information. Accordingly, we construct two momentum strategies based on past intraday and overnight returns, namely the intraday momentum (IMOM) and overnight momentum (OMOM). We show that the IMOM strategy generates significantly positive returns while the OMOM strategy generates significantly negative returns, and that such phenomena exist up to one year. We further confirm that the IMOM profits are induced by investor underreaction while the OMOM reversals are due to investors' price correction of initial overreaction. Finally, we show that a major advantage of the IMOM strategy is that its profitability is stable over time and is less prone to the momentum crashes.",

        "abstract": "This paper makes use of two types of extreme value distributions, namely: the generalized extreme value distribution often referred to as the block of maxima method (BMM), and the peak-over-threshold method (POT) of the extreme value distributions, to model the financial tail risks associated with the empirical daily log-return distributions of the Dow Jones Islamic market (DJIM), the U.S. S&P 500, the S&P Europe (SPEU), and the Asian S&P (SPAS50) indexes during the period between 01/01/1998 and 16/09/2015. Using both the maximum likelihood (ML) method and the bootstrap simulations to estimate the parameters of these extreme value distributions in the left and right tails separately, we find that the empirical distributions of conventional stock markets are characterized by a fat-left tail behaviour, which implies high probability of price drops during a financial crisis, and by a right-tail characterized by a truncation. This finding implies the existence of an upper bound on possible profit during an extreme event. The empirical distribution of the Islamic market is characterized by a thin-left tail behaviour, implying moderately low probability of price drops during a financial crisis, and by a right-tail without truncation implying large probability of positive returns during an extreme event. We divide our sample period into three equal sub-periods in order avoid the impact of outliers and structural breaks. The results in each sub-period remain the same and also suggest that for all stock returns the BMM method performs better than the POT method, and that the Islamic stock market is less risky than the conventional stock markets during extreme events.",

Trading the liquid asset does not involve transactions costs while trading the illiquid asset requires a fixed transaction fee. Both assets cannot be sold short. Agents receive an exogenous income. We look at the equilibrium rates of return of the two assets when the transaction fee is small, under two scenarios: when the number of illiquid assets is constant and the rate of return of liquid assets is zero, and when the number of illiquid assets is constant and a financial intermediary issues a quantity of liquid assets proportional to the liquidity premium (the difference between the rates of return of the two assets). We find that the optimal policy for a young agent is to accumulate the liquid asset in order to convert it into the illiquid asset at successive points in time. An old agent does the opposite and converts a portion of his holding of illiquid assets back into the liquid asset each time he has consumed all his stock of the latter. The liquidity premium is larger in the second scenario where it is proportional to the cubic root of the transaction fee. It is smaller in the first scenario where it is proportional to the square root of the fee.",

Preopening quotes posted by wholesalers (dealers specialized in market-making and thus presumably more exposed to inventory risks) are strongly related to opening price reversals, a measure of transitory price pressure. Wholesalers are more likely to post preopening quotes on days characterized by large liquidity shocks or days following larger order imbalances, but not on days of strong informational asymmetry about fundamentals (days of analyst recommendation releases, earnings announcements or merger announcements). These patterns do not hold for other intermediaries, namely institutional brokers providing sell-side coverage. I also nd that daily order imbalances (another trading pressure measure) are strongly related to the preopening activity of wholesalers but not to any other groups of market-makers with more diversied banking activities. Overall, I interpret this as evidence that non-fundamental information matters during the preopening session and impacts intermediaries' preopening behavior.",

For each market and at a given horizon, we show that the risk premium is well determined by the conditional expected variance of the change in the real exchange rate, agents' real net market position in assets and a constant composite risk aversion coefficient, as suggested by a two-country portfolio asset pricing model. The expected variance depends on the past values of the observed variance and the unobservable real net market position is estimated as a state variable using the Kalman filter methodology. We found that the trends of our estimated horizon-specific net market positions are consistent with the ones of the observed short term aggregate net market positions calculated using the U.S. Treasury International Capital System dataset. Moreover, we show that the ex-post premia tend to adjust towards the ex-ante values, suggesting that experts' beliefs provide a relevant information to the market.

We find that individual return volatilities are affected by a systematic market effect, day effects and announcements related to macroeconomic environment, strategic and financial dealings and commercial outcome, the two latter events being specific to the firm or to its competitors. The volatility responses have delayed and progressive patterns with persistence horizons ranging from one to three hours, suggesting that agents access to complete information gradually.",

The time-variability of the cost/aversion ratios justifies at the aggregate level a representation of expectations as a linear combination of the traditional extrapolative, adaptive and regressive processes augmented by a forward market component, whose parameters are allowed to change over time. This mixed expectation model with unstable heterogeneity is validated by our Kalman Filter estimation results for the two currencies and the two horizons considered. Although the chartist behavior, gathering the extrapolative and adaptive components, appears to dominate the fundamentalist behavior, described by the regressive and forward market components, the relative importance of the fundamentalists (chartists) is found to increase (decrease) with the time-horizon.",

According to a two-country portfolio asset pricing model, the risk premium is modeled as the product of three factors: a constant risk aversion coefficient, the expected variance of the rate of change in the real exchange rate, and the spread between domestic agent\u00e2\u0080\u0099s market position in foreign assets and foreign agent\u00e2\u0080\u0099s market position in domestic assets (net market position). When the returns are partially predictable, the expected variance is horizondependent and this is a sufficient condition for agents not to require at any time a unique risk premium for all maturities but a set of premia scaled by the time horizon of the investment. For each horizon the expected variance is assumed to depend on the historical values of the variance and on the unobservable maturity-dependent net market positions which have been estimated through a state space model using the Kalman filter methodology. We find that the model explains satisfactorily both the common and the non-random specific time-patterns of the 3- and 12-month ex-ante premia.",

It is shown that, according to previous studies, there is little evidence of the reaction of the market to those surprises. News about inflation, U.S consumption and real economic activity are specially expected by investors. It confirms the leading role of the U.S. economy and in particular of U.S. consumers in determining the development of the world economy and the dynamics of stock markets. Results also show that unexpected positive surprise in the unemployment rate causes a cut on future excess returns and future dividends. The opposite reaction is observed from the housing starts indicator. The consumer price index appears to have an impact not only on future excess returns, but also on future real interest rates.",

The friction premium is stronger among small, low price, volatile, value, and illiquid stocks. Return spreads associated with momentum and idiosyncratic volatility are smaller and statistically less significant than previously documented after screening out stocks with high microstructure frictions.

Second, nearness to a 52-week high induces underreaction to news. Among positive earnings surprise stocks, post-announcement drift exists only for those stocks near a 52-week high.

To circumvent the mechanical inverse relationship between price and expected return, we construct a novel way of examining the effect of nominal price on the cross section of stock returns. In the cross-section, a portfolio exploiting this strategy generates a value-weighted (equal-weighted) four-factor alpha of 85 (88) basis points per month, while raw price does not predict return robustly. Consistent with a mispricing-based explanation, the results are stronger for hard-to-arbitrage stocks and following high sentiment periods, and strategy returns are highly correlated with contemporaneous changes in sentiment. Using stock splits as an exogenous change in price level, we find that the post-split return dynamics mimic those predicted by our hypothesis. Evidence from earnings surprises and analyst price target forecasts confirms that beliefs are overly optimistic for low-priced stocks. Providing further evidence that the results reflect a belief-based rather than purely a preference-based channel, we find that the effect is distinct from other gambling related proxies that have been used in the past such as extreme returns, idiosyncratic volatility, and skewness.",

Bid and ask returns are decomposed into a common (\u00e2\u0080\u009defficient return\u00e2\u0080\u009d) factor and two market-side-specific components capturing market microstructure effects. The corresponding variance components reflect information-driven and noise-induced volatilities. We find that all volatility components reveal distinct dynamics and are positively influenced by news. The proportion of noise-induced variances is highest before announcements and significantly declines thereafter. Moreover, news-affected responses in all volatility components are influenced by order flow imbalances.",

We find that the well-documented impact-reversal pattern for the returns of fire sale stocks (e.g., Coval and Stafford, 2007) spills over onto the stock returns of economic peers, with a magnitude that is around one fifth of the original effect. These spillovers extend to liquidity and are not explained by common funding shocks or the hedging activity of liquidity providers. We conclude that they represent information spillovers due to learning from prices, thus identifying cross-asset learning as an important driver for the commonality in returns and liquidity.",

We use Shannon and R\u00c3\u00a9nyi entropy transfer techniques instead of the commonly used Granger causality approach to get robust estimates while allowing for nonlinear, non-parametric, and asymmetric relationships in bivariate returns series. The study\u00e2\u0080\u0099s findings support a unidirectional information flow from silver to gold, but not the other way around. Similarly, over the whole sample, a unidirectional information flow from oil to gold is observed but during the financial crisis of 2008\u00e2\u0080\u009309, the flow of information is reversed from gold to oil. Furthermore, during COVID, there is no statistically significant information transfer between \u00e2\u0080\u009cgold and oil.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Throughout the study period, a bidirectional information flow between \u00e2\u0080\u009csilver and oil\u00e2\u0080\u009d is observed.

The study revealed that past own shocks and volatilities significantly contribute to current volatilities in exchange rate and oil price markets. Also, there is bidirectional shock and volatility spillover between the exchange rate (USD/Naira and effective/Naira) and WTI oil price markets. There were bidirectional shock and volatility spillover between USD/Naira and Brent oil price and unidirectional shock and volatility from Brent oil price to effective exchange rate market. We found asymmetric shocks impacting exchange rates and WTI oil price while symmetric shock was observed in Brent oil price. Including innovation in oil price is essential in exchange rate policy formulation and modelling exchange rate shock and volatility.",

We consider inflation, real risk-free rate, real stock returns, equity premium and price/dividend ratio, annually from 1871 to 1993. When focusing exclusively on the long-run frequency, the estimated order of integration varies considerably, but nonstationarity is found only for the price/dividend ratio. When the cyclical component is also taken into account, most series appear to be stationary and to exhibit long memory. Further, mean reversion occurs. Finally, the fractional (at zero and cyclical) models are shown to forecast more accurately than rival ones based on fractional and integer differentiation exclusively at the zero frequency.",

However, empirical results show that such measures of market expectations are too noisy to predict day-to-day changes in the funds rate target; partly due to time aggregation problems, partly because they are affected by funds rate movements not directly related to monetary policy considerations. In particular, the futures market shows a large amount of systematic variation across months and trading days, variation that needs to be taken into account when predicting policy moves or extracting policy expectations. For the period from January 1994 to February 1998, the extracted expectations perform fairly well in predicting the target level that will prevail after the next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, especially when adjusting for market regularities.",

Paper concludes that the misalignment of asset prices during current financial crisis was not significantly different from their values from the second part of nineties.",

        "abstract": "We suggest that there is a significant relationship between cross-market comovement and time varying volatility. The time-varying component of cross-market dependence is attributed to the intertemporal risk-return adjustment by rational, risk-averse investors who systematically revise their expectation in response to changing volatility. To reflect the time-varying component of cross-market dependence, we propose a time-varying correlation test for contagion. Our results show that out of the countries reporting contagion evidence under the constant correlation test, none of the countries exhibits contagion evidence from the 1997 Asian crisis. We conclude that a high level of cross-market correlation during a crisis reported as contagion evidence under the standard constant correlation test is mostly due to the high level of cross-market co-movement resulting from the intertemporal risk-return adjustment.",

We use the daily series over a sampling period spanning from December 2017 to September 2022. We focus on several events that have spread severe risk throughout cryptomarkets, such as the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020, the governmental announcements and environmental concerns of 2021, and the crypto-winter cases of 2022. We calculate the symmetric and asymmetric volatility impulse responses (VIRFs) using a VEC-BEKK-MGARCH model and the Hafner and Herwartz (2006) framework. The results of the VIRF analysis demonstrate the existence of asymmetric responses between the two markets, with the shock of the COVID-19 pandemic exerting a greater impact on the variance of the futures market than on that of the spot market. Additionally, we employ the connectedness approach of Diebold and Yilmaz (2012, 2014) as modified by Gabauer (2020) and apply a DCC-GARCH model to examine the volatility spillovers across the two markets. Our results suggest that the bitcoin spot market is the dominant transmitter of volatility shocks to the futures market.",

The proposed tests are used to examine time-varying information spillover among global crude oil markets. The results provide empirical evidence of time-varying information spillover. In particular, the instantaneous causal effects of Dubai and Tapis crudes on Brent and WTI become stronger when a major event or events occur in major oil-producing countries. Such events include the Iraq War in March 2003, OPEC's announcement of a record production cut in December 2008, and the Libyan civil war in early 2011. And consistent with previous studies, WTI and Brent play dominant roles in global crude markets. Impulse response analysis shows that market information has a positive influence on the spillover effect in global crude oil markets. Moreover, the DCC-MGARCH Hong test consistently leads the rolling Hong test, which indicates that the former performs better.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes an intraregionally-focused tri-currency modeling framework to investigate dynamic information spillovers across spot and forward exchange rate markets in frontier and emerging country currencies, for both price levels and volatilities. Empirical estimates of structural parameters were obtained using an MGARCH\u00e2\u0080\u0093MSKST model that incorporated the term structure of non-deliverable forward (NDF) and deliverable forward (DF) markets, the dominance of regional currencies, and the influence of differing forward contract maturities (1-, 3-, 6- and 12-months). The currencies for nine countries were grouped into three regions: Northeast Asia (China, Korea and Taiwan); South/Southeast Asia (India, Indonesia and Philippines); and Latin America (Brazil, Chile and Columbia). The currency for each selected country was evaluated within the regionally determined tri-currency system. We found that NDF markets play a dominant role over DF markets with regard to price discovery during periods of tranquility. During periods of crisis, both NDF and DF markets exhibit a more balanced impact on currency market price discovery mechanisms. In addition, distinct differences were observed across regions: currencies in Northeast Asia were shown to be affected by the Chinese renminbi during periods of crisis and the Indian rupee could be regarded as the dominant currency in South/Southeast Asia. No robust results were obtained with regard to the dominance of currencies in Latin America. Finally, our results also suggest important distinctions between the effect of various instrument maturities on NDF and DF market returns \u00e2\u0080\u0093 with DF returns being more responsive to longer maturities (6-months and 12-months). During tranquil periods NDF returns are more responsive to shorter maturities, but during crisis periods this effect is diminished.",

For earnings announcements of US firms, I find that a one standard deviation increase in dispersion accelerates trading, reducing the difference between turnover around and before announcements by 8.50%. A similar increase in the PIN delays trading, raising the difference by 8.29%. These results help to explain why a large number of events have high turnover before earnings announcements relative to turnover after their release. Furthermore, the information contained in the time-series difference between trading around and before announcements helps to separate the impact of information asymmetry from the impact of proxies for differences of opinion. I also present a theoretical model in which agents who receive private information of heterogeneous quality trade a stock before and after observing a public signal. This public signal is interpreted differently across agents, leading to differences of opinion. I obtain closed-form solutions for expected aggregate volume and its derivatives with respect to these variables, showing that extending static models of asymmetric information is not enough to match the empirical findings.",

We argue that, when trading frequencies differ across traders, asset prices reflect investors' Higher Order Expectations (HOEs) about the two factors that influence the aggregate demand: fundamentals information and liquidity trades. We show that it is precisely when asset prices are driven by investors' HOEs about fundamentals that they over-rely on public information, the market displays high illiquidity, and low volume of informational trading; conversely, when HOEs about fundamentals are subdued, prices under-rely on public information, the market hovers in a high liquidity state, and the volume of informational trading is high. Over-reliance on public information results from investors' under-reaction to their private signals which, in turn, dampens uncertainty reduction over liquidation prices, favoring an increase in price risk and illiquidity. Therefore, a highly illiquid market implies higher expected returns from contrarian strategies. Equivalently, illiquidity arises as a byproduct of the lack of participation of informed investors in their capacity as liquidity suppliers, a feature that appears to capture some aspects of the recent crisis.",

We test this hypothesis using four major currencies: the Canadian dollar, German mark, and the British pound, against the US dollar. Results indicate that the evidence for the forward discount puzzle becomes significantly weaker after allowing for an adjustment period of as little as 18 months. These results are robust to different specifications, such as the use of different maturities or base currencies, and also hold for the New Zealand dollar and the Swedish krona, two smaller, but independent currencies.",

However, empirical results show that such measures of market expectations are too noisy to predict day-to-day changes in the funds rate target; partly due to time aggregation problems, partly because they are affected by funds rate movements not directly related to monetary policy considerations. In particular, the futures market shows a large amount of systematic variation across months and trading days, variation that needs to be taken into account when predicting policy moves or extracting policy expectations. For the period from January 1994 to February 1998, the extracted expectations perform fairly well in predicting the target level that will prevail after the next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, expecially when adjusting for market regularities.",

The departure from earlier studies lies in the way we test for profitability. To avoid the serious problem of data-snooping we apply the procedure provided by White (2000). Overall, we find strong evidence of a momentum effect where an investor takes a long position on the winner portfolio and a short position on the loser portfolio. Hence, we reject the hypothesis of weak market efficiency. Splitting the sample in two parts, 1963:07 to 1981:12 and 1982:01 to 2002:12 we found that the best momentum strategy was profitable during the first period and not during the second. The overall significance is thus driven by events in the earlier part of the sample and it appears that the market has become more efficient.",

Specifically, whole milk powder accounts for 6 to 11 percent of total exports, and its price is determined in twice-monthly auctions. I use event studies to quantify the impact of surprise auction results on the New Zealand dollar on a high-frequency basis. I find that a 1 percent increase in whole milk powder prices has a modest, but nevertheless significant, effect on the nominal exchange rate that does not seem to be explained by interest rate movements. Rather, the effect seems to be driven by a combination of two channels: a financial flows channel and a fundamental channel.

        "abstract": "We combine self-collected historical data from 1867 to 1907 with CRSP data from 1926 to 2012, to examine the risk and return over the past 140 years of one of the most popular mechanical trading strategies ? momentum. We find that momentum has earned abnormally high risk-adjusted returns ?a three factor alpha of 1 percent per month between 1927 and 2012 and 0.5 percent per month between 1867 and 1907 ? both statistically significantly different from zero. However, the momentum strategy also exposed investors to large losses (crashes) during both periods. Momentum crashes were predictable ? more likely when momentum recently performed well (both eras), interest rates were relatively low (1867?1907), or momentum had recently outperformed the stock market (CRSP era) ? times when borrowing or attracting return chasing ?blind capital? would have been easier. Based on a stylized model and simulated outcomes from a richer model, we argue that a money manager has an incentive to remain invested in momentum even when the crash risk is known to be high when (1) he competes for funds from return and (2) he is compensated via fees that are convex in the amount of money managed and the return on that money.",

        "abstract": "Modern investors face a high-dimensional prediction problem: thousands of observable variables are potentially relevant for forecasting. We reassess the conventional wisdom on market efficiency in light of this fact. In our model economy, which resembles a typical machine learning setting, N assets have cash flows that are a linear function of J firm characteristics, but with uncertain coefficients. Risk-neutral Bayesian investors impose shrinkage (ridge regression) or sparsity (Lasso) when they estimate the J coefficients of the model and use them to price assets. When J is comparable in size to N, returns appear cross-sectionally predictable using firm characteristics to an econometrician who analyzes data from the economy ex post. A factor zoo emerges even without p-hacking and data-mining. Standard in-sample tests of market efficiency reject the no-predictability null with high probability, despite the fact that investors optimally use the information available to them in real time. In contrast, out-of-sample tests retain their economic meaning.",

Our model decomposes yield curve shifts into two components: a virtually permanent change related to order flow and a transitory, price pressure effect due to dealer inventories. We find strong evidence that net dealer Treasury inventories has impact on the yield curve. Cash Treasury instruments in inventory have a larger impact on yields than futures contracts, suggesting that cash and futures inventories are not perfect substitutes. Price discovery in the level of interest rates is most strongly linked to non-dealer order flow in the 10-year futures contract, while price discovery in the slope of the curve is linked to order flow in the 10-year futures and the 5-year cash market.",

This approach shows that VIX derivatives carry different information about future variance than S&P 500 (SPX) options, especially during the 2008 financial crisis. I find that the segmentation is associated with frictions such as funding illiquidity, market illiquidity, and asymmetric information. When they are segmented, VIX derivatives contribute more to the variance discovery process than SPX options. These findings imply that VIX derivatives would offer a better estimate of expected variance than SPX options, and that a measure of segmentation may be useful for policymakers as it signals the severity of frictions.",

The distribution of these trader position changes carries important information about liquidity demand in the market. From this distribution of trader position-changes, we construct a marketwide measure for intraday liquidity demand that does not necessarily depend on aggressive trading. Using a rich regulatory dataset on S&P 500 E-mini futures and 10-year Treasury futures markets, we show that this liquidity demand measure has a positive impact on prices. We then decompose our measure of liquidity demand into three components: aggressive, passive and mixed liquidity demand. Passive liquidity demand also has an impact on prices; a one standard deviation increase in passive liquidity demand is associated with 0.5 tick rise in prices for S&P 500 E-mini futures. In addition, we find that new information is incorporated into the prices when passive liquidity demanders take positions. By providing direct evidence, we contribute to the growing literature on the impact of passive limit orders.",

We also find that the larger the prior gain, or the drop in stock price after the sell, the more likely is the investor to repurchase the same stock. Additionally, we find that (1) local stocks with negative market adjusted performance are more likely to be repurchased, and (2) less active, under-diversified, and poor performance investors are more likely to engage in such behavior. Overall, our results indicate that reference prices, prior stock returns, stock visibility, and investor performance and sophistication are determinants of the repurchasing behavior.",

We find that the LPPLS framework is able to successfully capture, ex-ante, some of the prominent bubbles across different time scales, such as the Black Monday, Dot-com, and Subprime Crisis periods. We then show that measures of short selling activity have robust predictive power over negative bubbles across both short and long time horizons, in line with the previous studies suggesting that short sellers have predictive ability over stock price crash risks. Market liquidity, on the other hand, is found to have robust predictive power over both the negative and positive bubbles, while its predictive power is largely limited to short horizons. Short selling and liquidity are thus identified as two important factors contributing to the LPPLS-based bubble indicators. The evidence overall points to the predictability of stock market bubbles using market-based proxies of trading activity and can be used as a guideline to model and monitor the occurrence of bubble conditions in financial markets.",

These include the Dow Jones Islamic market (DJIM), the U.S. S&P 500, the S&P Europe (SPEU), and the Asian S&P (SPAS50) indexes. Using the maximum likelihood (ML) method and the bootstrap simulations to estimate the parameters of these extreme value distributions, we find a significant difference in the tail risk behaviour between the Islamic and the conventional stock markets. We find that the Islamic market index exhibits fat tail behaviour in its right tail with high likelihood of windfall profit during extreme market conditions probably due to the ban on short selling strategies in Islamic finance. However, the conventional stock markets are found to be more risky than the Islamic markets, and exhibit fatter tail behaviour in both left and right tails. Our findings suggest that during extreme market conditions, short selling strategies lead to larger financial losses in the right tail than in the left tails.",

Using weekly portfolio fund flows data, the paper finds that their short-run dynamics are driven mostly by global \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093push\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac factors. To what extent do these cross-border flows and global risk aversion drive asset volatility in EMs? We use a Dynamic Conditional Correlation (DCC) Multivariate GARCH framework to estimate the impact of portfolio flows and the VIX index on three asset prices, namely equity returns, bond yields and exchange rates, in 17 emerging economies. The analysis shows that global risk aversion has a significant impact on the *volatility* of asset prices, while the magnitude of that impact correlates with country characteristics, including financial openness, the exchange rate regime, as well as macroeconomic fundamentals such as inflation and the current account balance. In line with earlier literature, portfolio flows to EMs are also found to affect the *level* of asset prices, as was the case in particular during the global financial crisis.",

Hence, the risk of momentum portfolios usually decreases with the prevailing price of risk, and their risk premiums are approximately negative quadratic functions of the price of risk (and the market premium) theoretically truncated at zero.

This study will make use of an event study to analyse the impact of those unconventional monetary policies implemented by the European Central Bank on nominal and real long-term interest rates. The long-term interest rates being considered are the 10-year government bond yield, the 5 and 10-year corporate bond yield (AAA and BBB) and the 5y5y swap forward rate for the Eurozone. The results show that unconventional monetary policy conducted by the ECB had a significant effect on real and nominal and long-term interest rates. This effect can be more persistent for a specific group of countries during some announcements, namely the 4th of September of 2014 announcement significantly lowered the 10-year government bond yield and BBB 5-year bond yield for Portugal and the remaining PIIGS.",

We develop a theoretical model of asset pricing and information processing, which allows for both rational traders and a variety of commonly studied behavioral biases.

We then test the model\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s theoretical predictions using a unique dataset which measures coverage of individual stocks in social and news media using a broad spectrum of print and online sources. Stocks with high social media coverage in one month experience high idiosyncratic volatility of returns and trading volume in the following month. Conversely, stocks with high news media coverage experience low volatility and low trading volume in the following month. These effects are statistically and economically significant and robust to controlling for stock and time fixed effects, as well as time-varying stock characteristics. The empirical evidence on news media is consistent with a market in which some traders are overconfident when interpreting new information.

We find strong empirical evidence in support of shifts in the steady-state and propose simple methods to adjust financial ratios for such shifts. The forecasting relationship of adjusted price ratios and future returns is statistically significant, stable over time, and present in out-of-sample tests. We also show that shifts in the steady-state are responsible for the parameter instability and poor out-of-sample performance of unadjusted price ratios that are found in the data.

We collect 3,643 estimates from 91 research articles and using recently developed techniques investigate the effect of publication and misspecification biases on the reported results. Correcting for these biases yields slope coefficients of 0.31 and 0.98 for developed and emerging currencies respectively, which implies that empirical evidence is in line with the theoretical prediction for emerging economies and less puzzling than commonly thought for developed economies. Our results also suggest that the coefficients are systematically influenced by the choice of data, numeraire currencies, and estimation methods.

The empirical results reveal that measures capturing offered quantities of a share at the best bid- and ask-price reveal more information about future short-run price movements than measures capturing the quantities offered at prices below and above. Imbalance and changes in offered quantities at prices below and above the best bid- and ask-price do, however, have a small and significant effect on future price changes. The results also indicate that the value of order book information is short-term.",

        "abstract": "Modern investors face a high-dimensional prediction problem: thousands of observable variables are potentially relevant for forecasting. We reassess the conventional wisdom on market efficiency in light of this fact. In our model economy, which resembles a typical machine learning setting, N assets have cash flows that are a linear function of J firm characteristics, but with uncertain coefficients. Risk-neutral Bayesian investors impose shrinkage (ridge regression) or sparsity (Lasso) when they estimate the J coefficients of the model and use them to price assets. When J is comparable in size to N, returns appear cross-sectionally predictable using firm characteristics to an econometrician who analyzes data from the economy ex post. A factor zoo emerges even without p-hacking and data-mining. Standard in-sample tests of market efficiency reject the no-predictability null with high probability, despite the fact that investors optimally use the information available to them in real time. In contrast, out-of-sample tests retain their economic meaning.",

We describe the behavior when some uninformed agents, who we call switchers, decide whether or not to pay for information before they trade. By paying for the information they behave as informed traders. First, we verify that our model is able to reproduce some of the stylized facts in real financial markets. Next we consider the relationship between switching and the market volatility under different structures of investors. We find that there exists a positive relationship between the market volatility and the percentage of switchers. We therefore conclude that the switchers are a destabilizing factor in the market. However, for a given fixed percentage of switchers, the proportion of switchers that decide to buy information at a given moment of time is negatively related to the current market volatility. In other words, if more agents pay for information to know the fundamental value at some time, the market volatility will be lower. This is because the market price is closer to the fundamental value due to information diffusion between switchers",

        "abstract": "US interest rates'overnight reaction to macroeconomic announcements is of tremendous importance trading fixed income securities. Most of the empirical studies achieved so far either assumed that the interest rates' reaction to announcements is linear or independent to the state of the economy. We investigate the shape of the tern structure reaction of the swap rates to announcements using several linear and non-linear time series models. The empirical results yield several not-so-well-known stylized facts about the bond market. First, and although we used a daily dataset, we find that the introduction of non linear models leads to the finding of a significant number of macroeconomic figures that actually produce an effect over the yield curve. Most of the studies using daily datasets did not corroborate so far this conclusion. Second, we find that the term structure response to announcements can be much more complicated that what is generally found: we noticed at least four types of patterns in the term structure reaction of interest rates across maturities, including the hump-shaped one that is generally considered. Third, by comparing the shapes of the rates' term structure reaction to announcements with the first four factors obtained when performing a principal component analysis of the daily changes in the swap rates, we propose a first interpretation and classification of these different shapes. Fourth, we find that the existence of some outliers in the one-day changes in interest rates usually leads to a strong underestimation of the reaction of interest rates to announcements, explaining the different results obtained between high-frequency and daily datasets: the first type of study seems to lead to the finding of fewer market mover announcements",

Results are strongest for news about employees on nonfarm payrolls in expansions.

Further, an attempt is made to examine the effect of various festivals on the performance of these indices. [Design/methodology/approach] For study purposes, closing prices of Nifty 50 and selected sectoral indices have been collected from the NSE India for the period of January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2021. The study employs descriptive statistics to know about the sample mean, standard deviation, sample variance, maximum, minimum, skewness, and kurtosis. Paired t-test was used to compare the returns of indices before and after the festival. Unit root test was used to test stationarity. Finally, the Granger causality test was applied to study the relationship between the Nifty 50 and sectoral indices returns. [Findings] According to this study, higher returns have been found for indices during Ramadhan and Christmas. Investors purchasing and selling behaviour is more positive during these times. During the pre-covid 19 period, Christmas is the only festival that shows positive returns in all sectoral indices. There is a positive return of all indices on Ramadhan and Diwali days during covid 19 period. The paired sample t-test showed that among all the festivals, Diwali is the only festival, which has an impact on the Nifty 50 and Nifty Auto index. The Granger causality test discovered a bidirectional relationship between Nifty Oil & Gas and Nifty health care, as well as Nifty 50 and Nifty Bank. [Originality/value] Festivals are one of the factors that attract investors into the market. It implants a positive attitude in the minds of investors. Decision science enables investors to analyse, quantify, and track the performance of their investments in different sectors. The findings of the study would be useful to investors, to come up with some investment strategies and maximize their returns during the festival season. Fund managers can restructure and allocate their funds based on sectoral indices performance.",

The daily observations from January 1, 2000 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 June 30, 2016 have been divided into three sub-periods along with the full sample period on the basis of structural breaks. Descriptive analysis used to calculate the average returns, which showed significant returns of KSE100 for the full sample, the first and the third sample periods as compared to gold returns. Standard deviation depicted the higher volatility in all the sample periods. Correlation analysis has shown an inverse relationship amid equity returns and gold returns, whereas, Philips-Perron and Augmented Dickey-Fuller tests have been employed, and time series data became stationary after taking the first difference. Johansen cointegration results have shown that the series are cointegrated in the full-sample and the first sample periods. Thus, this has demonstrated the long run association amid equity returns and gold returns in the first sub-sample and the full-sample periods. However, the second and the third sub-sample periods do not exhibit long-term association amid equity returns of KSE100 and gold returns. The outcomes of Granger causality approach identified bidirectional causation amid equity returns and gold returns in the full sample period in lag 2, and unidirectional causality has been observed from gold prices to stock prices in the full sample and the first sub-sample periods in lag 1 and lag 2 respectively.",

These events tend to be associated with large positive returns in the period when the events are predicted to occur (without conditioning on the outcome or existence of the event itself). These returns occur mainly on the long side of the portfolio, are statistically and economically large when value weighted, and replicate internationally. It is difficult to explain the observed patterns with a unified risk theory. Some of the underlying causes seem to be related to idiosyncratic risk, predictable attention, probability mistakes, and demand for corporate distributions.",

Measurable effects of announcements arise with a one-day delay meaning that government bond markets take some time to react to ECB announcements. The country-specific extent of yield reduction seems inversely related to the solvency rating of the corresponding countries. The spread between core and periphery countries reduces because of a stronger decrease in the latter. This result is confirmed by letting the announcement variable interact with the current spread level.",

        "title": "DO DIVIDEND SHOCKS AFFECT EXCESS RETURNS: AN EXPERIMENTAL STUDY",
        "abstract": "The dividend announcement of a company is an informational event that can cause underreaction, momentum, overreaction, post-dividend announcement drift, and mean reversion. It is the uncertainty surrounding dividend announcements that leads to such behavioural phenomena. Most authors consider that underreaction occurs after dividend shocks because new information about the dividend is being slowly and gradually built into the stock price. The effect of dividend shocks is often reflected in excess returns, which can last up to one year after the shock. The experiment described in this paper tests whether statistically significant excess returns are realized after a shock dividend announcement. Participants trade with the stocks of two companies, which only differ by dividend-generating stochastic process. The dividend process of Company 2 is a Merton-style jump-diffusion process (consisting of two parts: Brownian motion and Poisson jump), while the dividend process of Company 1 contains only the Brownian motion component. Statistically significant excess returns are expected when trading with Company 2 stocks. An autoregressive model is applied in order to test this hypothesis. The conclusion is that a dividend shock is followed by statistically significant excess returns in 20 of the 22 experiments, which implies that markets are inefficient after sudden and large changes in dividends. Underreaction and discount rate effects are identified.",

The inquiry is guided by multidisciplinary behavioural-related theories. The analyses employed a long span of Bursa Malaysia stock market data from 1977 to 2014 along the different phases of economic development and market states. The tests confirmed the presence of asymmetric dynamic behaviour of prices predictability as well as risk and return relationships across different market states, risk states and quantiles data segments. The efficiency tests show trends of an adaptive pattern of weak market efficiency across various economic phases and market states. Collectively, these evidences lend support to bounded-adaptive rational of investors' behaviour, dynamic stock price behaviour, and accordingly forming bounded-adaptive market efficiency.",

Employing a survey and ordinal regression models, the findings demonstrate that investment characteristics such as active trading, usage of internet and telephone, and saving for retirement objective are likely to improve diversification, whereas diversification worsens with the spending less time on researching investment. With respect to stock's characteristics, trading volume and return on asset are related to better diversification, whereas profit margin and return on equity are related to least diversification. The predictors are found to vary across professionals' gender, income and experience.

        "abstract": "We study the asset pricing implications of firms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 participation in the global supply chain. A firm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s global sourcing strategy serves as an option to hedge its value against trade shocks. Higher output tariffs increase firm value through reduced import competition, whereas higher input tariffs decrease firm value through higher input costs. The negative effects of input tariffs are more substantial for firms more reliant on foreign suppliers. We test the theoretical predictions in the context of the US-China trade war and quantify the impact of trade protectionism on Chinese firm value. One standard deviation increase of input tariff reduces the daily stock return by 0.12 percent for firms importing inputs, more than offsetting the gains from raising output tariffs by one standard deviation. The negative effect of input tariffs is larger for firms with high import intensity and low import substitutability. The welfare loss of the Chinese retaliatory tariffs was as much as $5.50 billion, 0.81% of the total value added of Chinese listed firms.",

        "abstract": "The Federal Reserve\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quantitative easing (QE) program has been accompanied by a flow of funds into emerging-market economies (EMEs) in search of higher returns. When Federal Reserve officials first mentioned an eventual slowdown and end of purchases under the central bank\u00e2\u0080\u0099s QE program in May and June 2013, foreign investors started to withdraw some of these funds, leading to capital outflows, a drop in EME currencies and stock markets, and a rise in bond yields. Using an event-study approach, this paper estimates the impact of \u00e2\u0080\u009cFed tapering\u00e2\u0080\u009d on EME financial markets and capital flows for 19 EMEs. Results suggest that EMEs with strong fundamentals (e.g., stronger growth and current account position, lower debt, and higher growth in business confidence and productivity), saw more favourable responses to Fed communications on tapering. Capital account openness initially played a role as well, but diminished in importance in subsequent tapering announcements.",

First, it documents the factors that characterize the intraday volatility process of the USD/MXN exchange rate at high frequencies based on a sample of five-minute returns from 2008 to 2017. Second, it empirically identifies the effects and the relative impact on the USD/MXN volatility process of various macroeconomic announcements, at different frequencies. The results conclude that the most impactful releases are associated with the monetary policy announcements by the Federal Reserve and Banco de M\u00c3\u00a9xico, together with the publication of some U.S. and China macroeconomic data.

        "abstract": "The purpose of this paper is to reconsider the empirical evidence on the relation between inflation, inflation uncertainty, and stock returns. Two unprecedented proxies for inflation uncertainty are used. First, the power of inflation and inflation uncertainty to explain stock returns is compared. Both variables are separately negatively related to stock returns. However, when both are included together in the regressions, the inflation variable becomes redundant, meaning that its coefficient becomes statistically insignificantly different from zero. This means that inflation uncertainty dominates and supplants the effect of inflation. Second, this paper provides strong evidence that inflation uncertainty itself becomes redundant, and fails to explain stock returns, when two fundamental variables are included in the regressions. The two fundamental variables are the change in the cost of equity, and the growth rate of earnings. The first variable is roughly measured by the change in the baa and in the aaa corporate bond yields, while the second one is taken to be the rate of change of industrial production. The main conclusion of the paper is that both inflation and inflation uncertainty are not significantly related to stock returns when the two aforementioned fundamental variables are accounted for.",

        "abstract": "This study investigates strategic aspect of leverage-driven bubbles from the viewpoint of game theory and behavioral finance. Even if a company is unproductive, its stock price grows up according to an exogenous reinforcement pattern. During the bubble, this company raises huge funds by issuing new shares. Multiple arbitrageurs strategically decide whether to ride the bubble by continuing to purchase shares through leveraged finance. We demonstrate two models that are distinguished by whether crash-contingent claim, i. e. contractual agreement such that the purchaser of this claim receives a promised monetary amount if and only if the bubble crashes, is available. We show that the availability of this claim deters the bubble; without crash-contingent claim, the bubble emerges and persists long even if the degree of reinforcement is insufficient. Without crash-contingent claim, high leverage ratio fosters the bubble, while with crash-contingent claim, it rather deters the bubble. We formulate these models as specifications of timing game with irrational types; each player selects a time in a fixed time interval, and the player who selects the earliest time wins the game. We assume that each player is irrational with a small but positive probability. We then prove that there exists the unique Nash equilibrium; according to it, every player never selects the initial time. By regarding arbitrageurs as players, we give careful conceptualizations that are necessary to interpret timing games as models of leverage-driven bubbles.",

Investors erroneously extrapolate past productivity growth and its associated operating performance and stock returns, despite their subsequent reversals. Such mispricing is perpetuated because of limits to arbitrage and is partially corrected around earnings announcements when investors are surprised by unexpected earnings news. Decomposition analysis indicates that extrapolative mispricing and limits to arbitrage explain most of the return predictability of firm-level productivity.",

        "abstract": "This paper investigated whether the stock price synchronicity level (SPSL) is a pricing factor in the Latin American scenario. To do so, the shares with the highest liquidity level listed in the stock exchange in five Latin American (LA) countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico and Peru) were used. The results indicated that the SPSL is associated with a positive premium. This premium was obtained by the CAPM model and by the Fama-French three- and five-factor models. There was evidence that the average SPSL increases in periods of greater turmoil in the financial markets. Moreover, it was found that the SPSLs are not associated monotonically with the efficiency levels of stock prices. Overall, the use of the SPSL factor in asset pricing models reduced the bias in estimating the stock premiums in LA.",

It is obviously important to better understand the dynamics of the price volatility between crude oil and coal in China, and then to build a reasonable energy portfolio. As the listing of China's crude oil futures offers a new sample to study the volatility contagion of oil and coal prices, by using daily data from 2nd May 2018 to January 23, 2020, four different multivariate GARCH models are compared and contrasted in this paper. Then, based on the results of the four MGARCHs, we investigate the oil-coal portfolios' optimal weights and hedge ratios. The results indicate that, first, a long-run co-integration relationship exists in China's crude oil and coal. Second, in short run, futures price of crude oil leads that of coal, the volatility spillover effect of crude oil on coal is stronger than that of coal on crude oil. Third, the DCC-GARCH model fits best for data. Last, weights of optimal portfolio and ratios of hedge show that the crude oil is a tool to make the risk of portfolio minimal in energy markets. These results are expected to have implications for energy producers, users and trading enterprises to inform their decision-making.",

We also found that cryptocurrencies were the main net transmitters of dynamic spillovers, while China's traditional financial assets were the primary net receivers. In addition, conventional financial assets were more sharply influenced by cryptocurrencies in the short term because the level of spillovers was more significant than in the long term, and spillover fluctuations were intense during the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings provide empirical support for the Chinese State Council's current policy regarding crackdowns on cryptocurrencies.",

We provide evidence that the state dependence in the stock market's response is explained by information about the expected equity premium and future corporate cash flows contained in monetary policy statements.

The model is tested using the U.S. S&P 500 stock market. The empirical findings of this investigation are consistent with the following notions. First, the equilibrium re-establishment process depends primarily on the option market and is triggered only when price deviations exceed a critical threshold. Second, arbitrage behaviors between the option and stock markets increase volatility in these two markets and reduce their correlation.",

The four exchange rate series exhibit significant multifractal properties on the whole time scale and the yen has the lowest multifractal properties among the four exchange rate series, showing the highest market efficiency. The multifractal properties of the four exchange rate series are due to both long-range correlation and fat-tail characteristics of non-Gaussian probability density function. The cross-correlations among different exchange markets reflect the internal linkages between different exchange markets. This paper also aims to compare the multifractality degrees of euro, pound, Canadian dollar, and yen exchange markets in three sub-samples divided by the 2008 financial crisis and the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u0080\u0099s announcement of its withdrawal from quantitative easing(QE) policy in 2014, finding that the four exchange markets all have multifractal structural properties with different levels in the sample and sub-samples that cause inefficiency with different levels in these foreign exchange markets. This may help study the impacts of these events on efficiency and risks in these exchange markets in each sub-sample from the statistical and fractal perspectives. This study has theoretical and practical significance in the application of Effective Market Hypothesis (EMH) in exchange market. Results of this study may also provide important implications for further study on the dynamic mechanism and efficiency in exchange market and help investors effectively control the market risks.",

Given the emergence of the S&P GSCI Natural Gas as the first most dominant energy natural gas market in the World, we use the daily return data of the S&P GSCI natural gas index for the empirical analysis. As a novel approach, we apply the Volatility Ratio, a contemporary technical statistic measure, to assess the behavior of the volatility-of-volatility at different time horizons in the natural gas market. Empirical findings of this paper reveal that the volatility-of-volatility had been rapidly dying down before the war, subsequently taking a longer time to die down in the S&P GSCI natural gas index. Further, the findings imply that periods of uncertainties trigger investors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 intent to make some best possible decisions and formulate superior strategies, without necessarily displaying any herding tendency of imitating their counterparts. Being the first study to apply the new volatility ratio analysis in accomplishing the aim of this research, our findings lay an economic foundation for necessary policy formulation and interventions to safeguard the energy market investors and counteract detrimental effects on society and economy at large, in the wake of any future Black Swan events such as the Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0093Ukraine conflict and the COVID-19 pandemic.",

This conclusion, however, relies on asset pricing models which might suffer from the joint hypothesis problem: That is, abnormal returns can reflect market inefficiencies, a bad asset pricing model or both. I contribute to the discussion by examining lottery-type assets on the European betting market. Compared to stock markets, betting markets offer the advantage that no asset pricing model is necessary to test market efficiency because outcomes are observable at a terminal point. I use a unique data set of soccer odds covering both a betting exchange and the bookmaker market. The findings reveal a favorite-longshot bias in both market structures confirming the findings from previous literature that lottery-type assets are mispriced. An expected utility model and a prospect theory model confirm that the favorite-longshot bias on the betting exchange is due to misperception of probabilities rather than risk-love. Although bookmakers also bias odds there is evidence that bookmakers are rational in protecting themselves from adverse selection and/or in increasing their turnover. This conclusion is supported by further analysis on the tennis betting market.",

I verify that companies with a higher percentage of individual investor ownership receive more news coverage, and that this effect is strongest among larger firms. In order to quantify the importance of this mechanism for stock prices, I estimate a panel VAR model and conduct a counterfactual analysis where the news coverage response to exogenous shifts in ownership composition is effectively \u00e2\u0080\u009cshut off\u00e2\u0080\u009d. The counterfactual analysis implies that an increase in news coverage triggered by a one standard deviation rise in individual ownership reduces annual stock volatility by 0.51% and annual returns by 0.135%, suggesting that the individual investor-news coverage channel partially offsets the more well-documented informational advantages of institutional ownership.",

        "abstract": "We apply the principal component analysis (PCA) and the partial least squares (PLS) methods to construct investor sentiment measurements and decompose them into total, local and global indices for the Mainland China (A-shares) and Hong Kong (H-shares) stock markets. Our results show that total investor sentiment is a strong predictor for the A-shares market, but it has hardly any effect in the H-shares market. We find that the sentiment differential, either total or local, has a positive relationship with the aggregate excess returns differential between the two markets, but the Hong Kong sentiment alone, either total or local, does not play much role. We further find that the sentiment differential is positively associated with the price premium of A-shares over H-shares. Our results are robust even after we add traditional factors.",

However, the reliability of return predictability is closely related to the noise contained in the data. In this study, we design a new method to address the noise in the framework of empirical mode decomposition. The EMD method provides an efficient return decomposition, and based on which we selectively remove high-frequency components that are more likely to be contaminated by outliers. Our new model delivers statistically and economically significant out-of-sample gains relative to the historical average. The predictive ability mainly originates from the business-cycle risk and survives a series of robustness tests.",

Furthermore, I find that conditional volatility persistence is the dominant channel linking the changing market states of each region to future volatility and its spillovers. Market state variables contribute to more than half of the explanatory power in predicting conditional volatility persistence, with the model that calibrates volatility persistence and spillovers conditionally on market states performing statistically and economically better. The utilization of market state variables significantly extends our understanding of the economic mechanisms of volatility persistence and spillovers and sheds new light on econometric techniques for volatility modeling and forecasting.",

These reserves, in turn, impact commercial bank credits/lending and U.S. stock market liquidity. We find that stock market liquidity varies across different monetary policy subperiods, where liquidity is strongly influenced by changes in bank lending and M2 money velocity. FED monetary policy that results in bank reserve increases generally stimulates bank lending and subsequently, is accompanied by stock liquidity gains. These linkages were observed during the 2007\u00e2\u0080\u009309 recession and QE-1 subperiods, where increasing FED assets and bank credits were accompanied by stock liquidity increases. However, even though FED assets and excess bank reserves increased substantially during QE-2 and QE-3, we find no commensurate increases in bank lending/credits or M2 Velocity. We find that QE-2 and QE-3 had no effect or negative impacts on stock liquidity. These findings support our hypothesis that enhancements in stock market liquidity generally occur only when FED stimulus coincides with commensurate increases in bank lending. Additionally, we find positive effects of short-selling during periods of high market uncertainty, and positive effects from the FED being allowed to pay interest on excess reserves (IOER).",

In addition, there exists a negative predictive relationship between investor sentiment and metal futures returns, which remains persistent even after controlling for liquidity and open interest.

In this last regime, results point to the disappearance of the previous significant effects across the US equity ETFs group. Unstable observed effects could have been motivated by market-specific conditions in such short time periods. The disappearance of these effects from 2001 onwards are consistent with the nature of this asset class: these ETFs are broadly diversified portfolios with diversification of private information, with higher liquidity and lower transactions cost, which is likely to reduce potential calendar effects.",

Previous empirical studies suggest that the positive overnight minus daytime mean return spread could be of economic significance. However, empirical evidence is not entirely consistent across studies. To examine this effect, we use various inference procedures: the mean-variance (MV), Sharpe ratio (SR), and stochastic dominance (SD) approaches. The MV and SR results suggest a decrease or even the disappearance of the positive overnight minus daytime mean return spread. The SD results show that overnight periods do not dominate and are not stochastically dominated by daytime period returns, in the sense of first-order SD. These SD findings suggest that no arbitrage opportunities exist in U.S. equity markets and investors could not increase their wealth and expected utilities by switching from any daytime to overnight periods, or vice versa, over weekdays.

In line with the idea that IDISP reflects dispersion in investors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 beliefs, we find that the negative IDISP-return relationship is particularly pronounced around earnings announcements, in high sentiment periods and among stocks that exhibit relatively high short-selling impediments.

Then, this study proposes an alternative measure of \u00e2\u0080\u0098magnitude of market inefficiency\u00e2\u0080\u0099 for accessing the trading systems and applies this measure to the nine stock markets during the two sub-periods. The trading systems of three markets improve in the second period, while the others become worse. This study also proposes an alternative measure of a fundamental value of stock price based on a macroeconomic model and makes clear the relation of the over- (under-) valuation of the market to the magnitudes of market inefficiency. Thus, the application to the Japanese stock market indicates that the magnitudes of inefficiency are small compared with the net over- (under-) valuations. It is because the magnitude of inefficiency is stationary while the net over- (under-) valuation is non-stationary.",

This performance of deep learning models for speculative stocks becomes pronounced when investor sentiment is high, and when new information is delivered through earnings announcements. Moreover, our nonlinear deep learning signals are negatively associated with analysts\u00e2\u0080\u0099 earnings forecast error especially for speculative stocks, implying that analysts\u00e2\u0080\u0099 forecasts are too low for speculative stocks with high deep learning signals.

The bubble deviation, at the stock level as opposed to the industry or market level, is a priced source of risk that is separate from the standard market risk, size and value factors.

We show that the early-stage (late-stage) momentum strategy of buying identified early-stage (late-stage) winners and selling identified early-stage (late-stage) losers outperforms (underperforms) the conventional momentum strategy of buying winners and selling losers across all momentum stages. We also find that the price momentum of the early-stage (late-stage) momentum strategy experiences slower (faster) reversal than that of the conventional momentum strategy. The outperformance of the early-stage momentum strategy comes primarily from the contribution of losers, as options-implied measures better place losers in their momentum stages than winners. Moreover, the identification ability of options-implied measures increases with the informativeness of the options market and, more importantly, is driven by their predictive information about a firm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fundamentals, particularly for profitability. Overall, our results indicate that options-implied information is useful in identifying the momentum stages of stocks.",

In this paper, we utilize weekly data from 07 August 2015 to 26 March 2021 to document the dynamics and portfolio diversification from a fresh cryptocurrencies-renewable energy perspective. Our time-frequency domain spillovers results reveal that renewable energy stocks are the main spillover contributors in the connectedness system and the short-run spillovers dominate their long-run counterparts. Furthermore, investors can gain more profits through short-run transactions in our portfolio design and we can optimize portfolios by investing a large portion in cryptocurrencies. A fascinating fact is that the COVID-19 pandemic can reverse the effectiveness of our hedging strategy.",

In particular, we examine which of the three (neutral, bear and bull) investors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 sentiments offer accurate forecast information on four energy futures prices. Using the predictability test proposed by Westerlund and Narayan (2015), we discover that all the forms of investors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 sentiments are significant predictors of the movements in energy futures prices. However, the bear sentiments outshine other variants in the forecast of crude oil futures prices, while the bull sentiments provide the most accurate forecast information for the remaining energy futures prices, namely heating oil, gasoline and natural gas. We also find this evidence consistent even when asymmetries are considered in the predictability models. Among other implications of these findings, investors in energy futures and portfolio managers are expected to consider often emotional perceptions in their portfolio constructions and the predictability of future gains.",

This study constructed a volatility spillover network weighted by the spillover intensity index. The overall network topological properties, node characteristics, and spillover structure were then analyzed by applying the index quantification and hierarchical clustering algorithm. This research examined the multi-level risk spillover structure while realizing network visualization and also judged the dynamic correlation among the spillover network structures. The findings show that the network topology properties are relatively stable, but there is a large heterogeneity among markets. Compared to the energy market, the cryptocurrency market exhibits more profound features of volatility resonance between different currencies. Traditional cryptocurrency markets display higher risk resonance levels than stable coins. In terms of risk spillover structure, different markets tend to rely on market attributes to demonstrate their spillover and agglomeration characteristics. In addition, the risk spillover resonance among the sub-networks is also dynamic and time-varying, and this network structure will continue over time.",

Empirical evidence suggests that Bitcoin market volatility substantially influences other markets. Moreover, given the intimate connections between BRICS countries and developed nations such as the US in today's globalized context, fluctuations in the Bitcoin market within BRICS countries are apt to impact US financial markets. Our empirical findings specifically indicate the following: (i) Among the total spillover effects of the cryptocurrency implied exchange rate discount in BRICS countries, Russia exhibits the most potent total spillover effect and contributes the most to market connectedness. (ii) The Brazil directional spillover index is elevated in both spillover relationship categories, and the spillover effect of the cryptocurrency implied exchange rate discount in Brazil on US financial variables is notably pronounced. (iii) Of the US financial variables, the US Financial Stress Index demonstrates the most robust connectedness with the cryptocurrency implied exchange rate discount in BRICS countries and exhibits heightened sensitivity to uncertainty.",

Using high-frequency data for China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stock market, we find that retail investor attention, measured by Baidu search volume, has a significantly positive short-term effect on future stock liquidity. When the time horizon expands, however, the positive effect weakens and eventually reverses after four weeks. More importantly, the observed short-term improvement on stock liquidity is mainly attributable to attention-induced retail investor net-buys. Taking advantage of variations of retail investor attention to stocks, sophisticated traders with superior information appear to engage in trades against retail investors.

Since the returns of VIX ETPs are closely linked to the VIX, our results imply that VIX ETP investors expect mean reversals in market risk. By comparing the ability of different asset pricing models to predict the flows, we find no evidence that investors in VIX ETPs consider systematic risk factors.

Prominent multifactor models deliver only a modest improvement, however, as they often resolve only those anomalies which are directly linked to their additional factors.

We also utilize the DCC-GARCH-t copula approach to examine the hedging effectiveness of the Australian sustainable and Islamic financial markets against the Australian conventional market's long-term volatility during high and low uncertainty. The time domain QVAR approach show that the Australian sustainable financial market returns receive the highest spillovers of shocks from TPU, FSI and GPR at the lower, medium and higher quantiles. Moreover, in the short term, at the lower quantiles the sustainable financial market receives the highest error variance contributions from FSI, while at higher quantiles, TPU, FSI and GPR transmit higher spillovers of shocks towards the sustainable market. Similarly, in the long term, the sustainable market receives the highest contributions to the error variances from TPU, FSI and GPR (GPR and TPU) at the lower (higher) quantiles. Moreover, at the lower, middle and higher quantiles, a shock in the Islamic (sustainable) market returns causes the highest contribution of error variances in the conventional market, compared with the (sustainable) Islamic market in the short and long run.

Based on a market anomaly related to the Capital Asset Pricing Model, this strategy uses daily beta as a signal for portfolio construction.

For this reason, we decided to compare the performance of the original BAB strategy with two BAB variants, where the signal for portfolio construction is given by intraday and overnight beta, respectively. Despite all strategies exhibiting positive cumulative returns, using the intraday beta signal leads to significantly higher performances. Further analyses show that the abnormal intraday BAB returns are mainly due to nano and micro-cap stocks which tend to outperform large-cap stocks, as well known from the literature.",

        "abstract": "The impact of Bitcoin futures introduction on the underlying Bitcoin volatility has been a controversial topic. Conflicting results had been obtained from different sample periods and methodologies. To address this debate, this study examines the impact of futures trading on volatility and volatility asymmetry of Bitcoin returns in the short and long run. Using exponential GARCH models, we introduce a dummy in the variance equation to capture the changes in the volatility after the introduction of Bitcoin futures. We find that after the introduction, spot return volatility decreases in the short run, but increases in the long run. Besides, in the short run, there exists an inverse leverage effect before and after the introduction; in the long run, the inverse leverage effect before the introduction changes to a usual level effect after the introduction. Finally, we examine whether greater futures trading activity, proxied by trading volume and open interest, is associated with greater Bitcoin volatility. To do so, we decompose each proxy into expected and unexpected components and document that, in the long run, Bitcoin volatility covaries positively with unexpected futures trading volume, but negatively with unexpected futures open interest.",

        "abstract": "The movement of international art prices in conjunction with other asset prices is preliminary to our understanding whether art is a luxury good. It is well known that there are linkages between art market prices and equity prices. However, less is known about the structure of dependence between these variables and the influence of gold prices and sentiment. We analyse art prices, at the outset using Granger causality and error correction models (ECM) to capture the long term dynamics between art prices, equity markets, gold prices and investor sentiment. The dataset we use is unique and covers British art prices from 1895 to the present. Initial results do not give a complete picture of price movements or a fitting description of wealth effects; to rectify this we look at short term dynamics in the art market. We assume a regime switching model to describe the movement of prices using a threshold variable that drives prices into possibly locally explosive regimes. These results indicate a dynamic wealth effect in that high (low) stock prices lead to subsequent increases (decreases) in art prices. However, this approach means that elasticities are now stochastic, and we redefine what a luxury good is. This is further explored by directly calculating elasticities from our model and its variants to analyse properties of art as a luxury good. Our threshold approach gives deeper insight into the impact of different market conditions than conventional ECM and cointegration modelling.",

In this study, we revisit the asymmetric volatility dynamics of major cryptocurrencies using asymmetric GARCH models that incorporate endogenously detected structural breaks. Our results show that after incorporating structural breaks, volatility persistence decreases and asymmetric volatility increases for all cryptocurrencies in this study. Thus, prior research that ignores structural breaks underestimates the impact of unexpected news on price volatility in cryptocurrency markets.

Due to an increase in market participants, more sophisticated algorithms than those used in the past are now required to generate excess returns in pairs trading strategies. Sophisticated algorithms can cause an increase in complexity which, in-turn, increases computational run time.

Among the languages that allow for faster development, Cython provides the best balance between run times and ease of prototyping.",

Assuming that agents are bounded by their information access and processing, what are the consequences on market dynamics? We expose the result of simulations in an ABM that considers the liquidity as an endogenous characteristic of the market and allows to design investors as bounded rational. In a call auction market, where two risky assets are exchanged, traders are defined as a mix between fundamentalist and trend-follower outlook. Each one differs as to behaviour, order-placement strategy, mood, knowledge, risk-aversion and investment horizon. We place agents in a context of evolving fundamental values and order placement strategy; they perceive the fundamental but they also have some heterogeneous belief perseverance; and they adapt their orders to the market depth so as to maximise their execution probability and their profit. By adding bounded rationality in their information processing, we show that (1) usual features as trend-follower outlook and heterogeneous investment horizon are important features to generate excess volatility of asset prices and market inefficiency; (2) the learning fundamental value stabilises the market price and the trading volume; (3) the order-placement strategy increases trading volume, but reduces market efficiency and stability; (4) the agent\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mood prevents illiquid market and weakly increases the market volatility as classical noise trader agents; (5) the impatience to sell of traders is always present in the market: the market sell orders are always more numerous than the market buy orders.",

A growing body of literature shows that financial markets do not reward the risk (defined in terms of standard deviation or market beta). These results (known as \u00e2\u0080\u0098low-risk anomaly\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and \u00e2\u0080\u0098low-beta-anomaly\u00e2\u0080\u0099) are quite puzzling from the theoretical perspective. This study presents an empirical test of the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) in the Indian equity market to examine the existence of low risk/low beta anomaly. The study covers 650 actively traded stocks for a period of 189 months from July 2002 to March 2018, and the Fama\u00e2\u0080\u0093MacBeth procedure has been used for testing CAPM. The beta-shorted portfolios are formulated using both equal and value-weights. The results of the study were found robust after controlling for outliers and correcting the bias in standard errors, as suggested by Petersen (in Rev Financ Stud 22(1):435\u00e2\u0080\u0093480, 2009). We confirm the presence of \u00e2\u0080\u0098low-beta-anomaly\u00e2\u0080\u0099 in India. A non-linear relationship was found between CAPM beta and expected returns. This relationship follows a quadratic function, where expected returns initially increase with beta and then start declining, resulting in the negative risk premium for high-beta portfolios.",

        "abstract": "We study investor overreaction using data for five major stock market crashes during the 1987-2008 period. We find some evidence of investor overreaction in all five stock market crashes. The prices of stocks investors bid down more than the average during crashes tend to increase more than the average in post-crash market reversals. In line with CAPM, we find that high beta stocks lose more value in crashes and gain more value in post-crash market reversals relative to low beta stocks. We further find that smaller firms and those with a low market-to-book ratio lose more value in stock market crashes. However, they do not gain more value in post-crash market reversals, implying that investor reaction against these firms in stock market crashes is not an overreaction. In examining industry-specific behavior, our results indicate that investors overbid down the prices of high-tech stocks in the 1997 crash and manufacturing stocks in the 2008 crash relative to other stocks. However, the prices of stocks in these industries increased more than other stocks in the post-crash market reversals, implying investor overreaction for these industries in these stock market crashes",

(J Polit Econ 98:703\u00e2\u0080\u0093738, 1990) to a model with multiple risky assets to demonstrate the effect of investor sentiment on the cross-section of stock returns. Our model formally demonstrates that market-wide sentiment leads to relatively higher contemporaneous returns and lower subsequent returns for stocks that are more prone to sentiment and difficult to arbitrage. Our extended model is consistent with the existing empirical evidence on the relationship between sentiment and cross-sectional stock returns. Guided by the extended model, wen also decompose investor sentiment into long- and short-run components and predict that long-run sentiment negatively associates with the cross-sectional return and short-run sentiment positively varies with the cross-sectional return. Consistent with these predictions, we find a negative relationship between the long-run sentiment component and subsequent stock returns and positive association between the short-run sentiment component and contemporaneous stock returns.",

This case of risk neutrality has been tested extensively especially in the foreign exchange market. This paper departs from this line of research and studies unbiasedness at the short end of the interest rate market. Although, a priori, an investment of 6 months and an investment of three months rolled over for an additional 3 months are commonly believed to be riskless at first approximation, our results show otherwise. The precision of our estimators unveil a small but statistically significant risk premium. The latter has two components, a constant risk premium and a time-variable one. The constant risk premium is estimated to be 14.4 basis points. The time-variable risk premium ranges between a maximum of 184.6 basis points, and a minimum of -123.2 basis points, and averages 5.4 basis points. The methodology in this paper is amenable and adaptable, with little adjustments, to other maturities. This is an agenda for the future.",

With daily-aggregated tick-by-tick data over three years on the Shanghai Security Exchange, we find negative cross-asset effects of order flow on returns, both between stocks and bonds and between corporate and Treasury bonds. Our results provide evidence that not only cross-market portfolio rebalancing under general market conditions, but also flight-to-quality, which occurs particularly under extreme market conditions, are responsible for the cross-market effects of order flow. In particular, while Treasury bonds play a dominant role in stock-bond portfolio rebalancing, corporate bonds can replace Treasury bonds as a safe \u00c2\u00a1\u00c2\u00a7haven\u00c2\u00a1\u00c2\u00a8 during extreme stock market conditions or during a fall in Treasury bond market returns.",

The main obstacle that we face when we use CAPM with private information is the unavailability of the observable variables that directly measure private information. Microstructure literature provides many models to estimate it. An important contribution in this way was moved forward by Easley, Kiefer, O'Hara and Paperman (1996). They estimate private information by probability of information-based trading (PIN). Our study concerns a sample of 40 quoted securities in Tunisian financial market, over the period going from January 02, 2010 until December 31, 2014, and results appear conclusive. Firstly, we show the existence of asset pricing bias compared to the standard CAPM. Secondly, we find a strong relation between private information (PIN), spread, buyer and seller trades returns. This is consistent with the idea of PIN capturing the probability of informed trading. Finally, the validity of PIN as measure of private information, gave us a motivation to test the validity of CAPM with private information cost based on Probability of Information-based Trading.",

I find that an increase in the fraction of Americans watching a TV show finale on a given day is immediately followed by a decrease in U.S. stock returns.

This requires new asymptotic theory which leads to several tests for the significance of function-valued regression coefficients. The new approach to the study of the significance of risk factors for a cross-section of returns complements the established Fama\u00e2\u0080\u0093French approach based on portfolio construction.

        "abstract": "Active opportunity in the market, measured by cross-sectional dispersion in stock returns, significantly influences fund performance. Active strategies have the greatest impact on returns during periods of high dispersion, when alpha produced by the most active funds significantly exceeds that produced in other months. The outperformance of the most relative to the least active funds is also concentrated in months of high dispersion. Deciding when to invest in active funds, therefore, can be as important to generating outperformance as deciding which funds to invest in. Switching between highly active and passive funds based on dispersion produces significant alpha of over 2.7% p.a. after fees. This paper adds a new dimension to understanding how active funds can be used to generate value, by combining identification of which managers have the greatest potential to outperform the market with insight into when the market is most conducive to outperformance.",

The existence of the Market Maker's finite price adjustment speed leads to the fact that prices do not adjust instantaneously to new information. Chartists use moving average rules to make their investment decisions. Chartist can transform an underreaction-only scenario into a market with overreaction. The use of long moving average rules might even make the market unstable. Furthermore, noise in financial markets can lead to long time decoupling from fundamental value. Higher market efficiency (low deviations from fundamental value), on the other hand, is achieved if high rationality and long-term thinking for the agents is assumed.",

By using post-hoc estimator approach of Lubotsky & Wittenberg (2006), we construct an efficient indicator for risk of default, by using sample of 252 US non-financial corporate data (2000-2010). On average, our results validate that almost 48% of change in yield spread is explained by default risk especially in recent financial crisis period (2007-2009).

A $100,000 inventory shock causes an average price pressure of 0.28% with a half-life of 0.92 days. Price pressure causes average transitory volatility in daily stock returns of 0.49%. Price pressure effects are substantially larger with longer durations in smaller stocks. Theoretically, in a simple dynamic inventory model the 'representative' intermediary uses price pressure to control risk through inventory mean reversion. She trades off the revenue loss due to price pressure against the price risk associated with remaining in a nonzero inventory state. The model's closed-form solution identifies the intermediary's relative risk aversion and the distribution of investors' private values for trading from the observed time series patterns. These allow us to estimate the social costs-deviations from constrained Pareto efficiency-due to price pressure which average 0.35 basis points of the value traded.",

The data cover 20 emerging markets over the period 1992-2006. We find that the replacement of a central bank governor negatively affects financial markets on the announcement day. This negative effect is mainly driven by irregular changes, i.e., changes occurring before the scheduled end of tenure, sending negative signals about perceived central bank independence. Personal characteristics of the central banker, to the contrary, are less important for market reactions. We find no evidence that changes in the central banker's conservatism affect the reactions of the markets.

The aim of this paper is twofold: to verify whether natural gas prices are converging into a single price in Europe and to identify the reference trading hub for the European market. We study the evolution of natural gas prices during the last decade (2007\u00e2\u0080\u00932017) at various trading hubs with the goal of identifying their level of integration. We examine the integration by testing for the presence of a common stochastic trend among the prices reported at the hubs. In order to detect the reference hub we test for a lead lag relationship between each pair of trading hubs. Our results show a high level of integration among the European trading hubs with the Dutch hub, TTF, playing the role of the reference trading hub.",

This mission is more difficult to accomplish when trading activity is associated with financial instability in the form of intraday price jumps. While the literature has widely shown that exogenous news releases trigger these jumps, very little is known about the consequences of endogenous technical trading on market instability. Using high-frequency 5-minute data on 460 NASDAQ stocks from February to September 2017, we provide new evidence that sharp price movements during the day are also triggered by technical trading around special market configurations. When technical trading activity dominates, intraday price jumps are detected more frequently, and their direction becomes significantly predictable, particularly in small caps and in the energy sector. Our results support the view that the explanations for intraday market instability are not limited to news releases.",

Using Frankel\u00c2\u00b4s model we include a Taylor rule equation in this theoretical model, which let us analyze the endogeneity problem. In order to find empirical support of this model, we estimate SVAR and, using quarterly data from 1962:Q1 to 2009:Q1, we find that the overshooting of commodity prices to 1% increase of real interest rate can be a minimum of 2.86% and a maximum of 5.97% depending on the chosen model. The increase of real interest rate given a 1% increase in commodity prices is positive and significant but of small magnitude (0.20% - 0.05%).\"",

Sample data cover the period from January 2008 to December 2017. The main sample was divided into two subperiods to insulate the dominating impacts of both the 2008 Global Financial Crisis and 2013 Federal Reserve Tapering on Turkish stock markets. The daily stock market data were collected from the Electronic Data Delivery System (EVDS) web service, while political news headlines were collected from the Guardian newspaper. Different nonlinear volatility models (symmetric and asymmetric Generalized AutoRegressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity [GARCH]-type models) were used to model and estimate BIST-100 volatility in response to political news. The findings of the paper highlight four main results. First, there seems to be a significant impact of political news on the returns and volatility of BIST-100 index. Second, negative shocks derived from bad news tend to have a significant impact on the returns and volatility of BIST-100, while positive shocks derived from good news do not tend to have any significant impact on the returns, but decreased returns volatility. Third, political news, both good and bad, can affect stock return and stock return volatility in different directions, and this direction is time-varying. Fourth, the findings strongly reveal the presence of \u00e2\u0080\u009cLeverage Effect\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the returns of BIST-100 index.

I propose a novel performance-based measure that disentangles the economic value of cross-predictability into two components: the predictive power of one asset's signal for other assets' returns (cross-predictive signals) and the amount of an asset's return explained by other assets' signals (cross-predicted returns). Empirically, the latter component dominates the former in the overall cross-prediction effects. In the crosssection, cross-predictability gravitates towards small firms that are strongly mispriced and difficult to arbitrage, while it becomes more difficult to cross-predict returns when market capitalization and book-to-market ratio rise.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Shannon entropy is the most common metric for assessing the degree of randomness of time series in many fields, ranging from physics and finance to medicine and biology. Real-world systems are typically non-stationary, leading to entropy values fluctuating over time. This paper proposes a hypothesis testing procedure to test the null hypothesis of constant Shannon entropy in time series data. The alternative hypothesis is a significant variation in entropy between successive periods. To this end, we derive an unbiased sample entropy variance, accurate up to the order $$O(n^{-4})$$ O ( n - 4 ) with n the sample size. To characterize the variance of the sample entropy, we first provide explicit formulas for the central moments of both binomial and multinomial distributions describing the distribution of the sample entropy. Second, we identify the optimal rolling window length to estimate time-varying Shannon entropy. We optimize this choice using a novel self-consistent criterion based on counting significant entropy variations over time. We corroborate our findings using the novel methodology to assess time-varying regimes of entropy for stock price dynamics by presenting a comparative analysis between meme and IT stocks in 2020 and 2021. We show that low entropy values correspond to periods when profitable trading strategies can be devised starting from the symbolic dynamics used for entropy computation, namely periods of market inefficiency.",

Trading in both bitcoin and ethereum has become more integrated across different cryptoexchanges since 2018. Bitcoin and ethereum spot many similarities in the behavior of price deviations for any given pair of exchanges and share similar trading dynamics on the same cryptoexchange. Returns on arbitrage trading of bitcoin and of ethereum exhibit very similar dynamics and properties across different cryptoexchanges, as well as over time. Profitable opportunities for arbitrage trading of either cryptocurrency across different cryptoexchanges have declined significantly since 2018. An introduction of a financial derivative traded at a regulated exchange that allows to benefit from decline in the price of bitcoin is found to have a significant impact on the dynamics of trading of both bitcoin and ethereum in the respective decentralized spot markets.",

Using financial data for the U.S. markets from 1962 to 2012, we confirm that earnings surprises and unemployment surprises significantly affect individual stock returns. Also, in line with Boyd et al. (J Bank Financ 60(2):649\u00e2\u0080\u0093672, 2005), we confirm that both surprises are significant during economic booms and contractions. However, while unemployment surprises are significant on a stand-alone basis, they are systematic events whose impact is captured within systematic risk-adjusted return models such as the Fama-French 3-factor and market models. This suggests that, for individual stocks, earnings surprises dominate unemployment surprises when dealing with simultaneous news releases. The stock market reaction to firm earnings surprises is enhanced during recessions, which can mostly be explained by systemic market functions.",

We observe both the beta and the tail risk anomalies at the univariate portfolio level. However, after controlling for the lottery effects (MAX and idiosyncratic volatility), the relationship between the systematic tail risk measures and the expected returns turns positive for some of the proxies of tail risk, while the relationship between beta and expected returns becomes flat. The lottery effect explains the tail risk anomaly reported in the literate. These results suggest that investors care for probabilities of extreme changes in stock prices but do not care much about moderate variations in stock returns. Emerging markets have a significant presence of individual investors, who consider investing in the stock market as an opportunity to gamble and earn lottery-like payoffs, which results in an overvaluation of lottery stocks. Since these stocks also have high systematic risk and a high probability of extreme negative returns, we observe that the expected returns are negatively correlated with beta and left tail risk measures before controlling for the lottery effects. These results are robust after controlling for other relevant variables such as the size of the firm, book-to-market ratio, momentum, retail ownership, and illiquidity.",

This methodology involves two phases. The first (filtering) leverages an automated process for the analysis, evaluation, and selection of the necessary and relevant information for the characterization of the behavior of each action. The second (the model adjustment phase) involves adapting and solving a multi-objective model for the prediction of prices of the selected stocks. The database used for this research includes the behavior of twelve significant stocks in the Mexican stock exchange during the 2006 to 2016 period, the source code used is available at \u00e2\u0080\u009chttp://bit.ly/396h3J1\u00e2\u0080\u009d; the data was obtained from a specialized financial markets platform for Latin America. The numerical results show that the filtering phase can identify a compact set of relevant variables with a significant influence on the future price of each stock. In the second phase, the data from 2016 is used to predict the multi-objective model, which compared with the multiple linear regression model, provides a considerable improvement in the quality of the predicted observed data. The model generated from the second phase has a reliability greater than 95%.",

Based on sample of daily data from January 6, 2004 up until December 13, 2019 the paper evaluated research hypothesis that assumed persistence of shocks in returns on 5Y Croatian bond. To evaluate the research hypothesis, the paper employed quantile autoregression approach and nonparametric time varying autoregreession approach. The empirical results rejected the research hypothesis assuming persistence of shocks in returns on CDS for 5Y Croatian bonds. Based on the results from this paper, returns on CDS from for 5Y Croatian bonds are in line with efficient market hypothesis for endogenous shocks of small magnitude and at the highest level of endogenous shocks. Furthermore, efficient market hypothesis holds during the calm periods, while during the periods with more dynamics in CDS prices the paper suggests profitable strategy for trader and investors. Eventually, the paper contributes to the ongoing discussion regarding efficient market hypothesis while revealing the case of returns on CDS for 5Y Croatian bonds. Furthermore, the paper suggests trading and investment strategies for investors.",

For this purpose, analyses were carried out by automatic portmanteau test with a 2-year sub-sample size using the daily data between 19.04.2000-07.02.2020 of 19 primary sector indexes within Borsa Istanbul. As a result of the analyses, it was understood that Transportation, Insurance, Electricity, and Metal Products Machinery sectors have higher return predictability periods and therefore their weak form market efficiency is lower than other sectors. In addition, it was determined that the sectors that have the least predictable periods of return, in other words, that have more weak form efficiency than other sectors, are Food Beverage, Banks, Wholesale and Retail Trade, and Wood Paper Printing.",

Preliminary evidence from Detrended Fluctuations Analysis (DFA) suggests the existence of long memory in all markets. We then use the fractionally integrated generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (FIGARCH) model to estimate the magnitudes of the long-memory parameter. Following the information of modified ICSS test, the Adaptive FIGARCH (A-FIGARCH) and the Time-Varying FIGARCH (TV-FIGARCH) are also employed to control for the potential effects of structural breaks. The results are generally robust with those obtained from the FIGARCH model. The significant long-memory suggests that the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) may not hold for the CDS spreads of those four countries.",

In this study we aim to find who beats the market using a special trade and portfolio data from a stock exchange namely Borsa \u00c4\u00b0stanbul. Instead of market data, investor based data used in this paper provides us to make stronger analyses. We initially find that 87% of individual and 92% of institutional investors get returns in a random way. Then the rest of investors are investigated to determine who consistently beats the market and gets abnormal returns. And we mainly find that the market beating gets longer with increasing portfolio size and diversification, while it gets shorter with increasing turnover. Additionally, longer beating length means higher shares of women, old adults, funds and foreigner. Furthermore, we analyze the return performance of investors in our study and show that the picture becomes reversed compared to beating length criteria. Finally, the insiders are compared with other investors to understand whether the market is efficient in the strong form or not. And the findings indicate that the insiders cannot be specifically differentiated from other investors. Therefore, we end up with the evidence that there is strong form efficiency in Borsa \u00c4\u00b0stanbul.",

        "abstract": "The problem of capital allocation to a set of strategies could be partially avoided or at least greatly simplified with an appropriate strategy approval decision process. This paper proposes such a procedure. We begin by splitting the capital allocation problem into two sequential stages: strategy approval and portfolio optimization. Then we argue that the goal of the second stage is to beat a na\u00c3\u00afve benchmark, and the goal of the first stage is to identify which strategies improve the performance of such a na\u00c3\u00afve benchmark. We believe that this is a sensible approach, as it does not leave all the work to the optimizer, thus adding robustness to the final outcome.We introduce the concept of the Sharpe ratio indifference curve, which represents the space of pairs (candidate strategy's Sharpe ratio, candidate strategy's correlation to the approved set) for which the Sharpe ratio of the expanded approved set remains constant. We show that selecting strategies (or portfolio managers) solely based on past Sharpe ratio will lead to suboptimal outcomes, particularly when we ignore the impact that these decisions will have on the average correlation of the portfolio. Our strategy approval theorem proves that, under certain circumstances, it is entirely possible for firms to improve their overall Sharpe ratio by hiring portfolio managers with negative expected performance. Finally, we show that these results have important practical business implications with respect to the way investment firms hire, layoff and structure payouts.",

However, this drastic fall was not persistent; rather a sharp recovery was witnessed as a result of sweeping investor enthusiasm and wide-ranging speculation. In this paper, we explore the relationship between investor sentiment, stock returns and important macro variables during the COVID-19 period spanning from January, 2020 to May, 2021. We have also conducted event analysis to see the significance of major events during the period. While the Great Lockdown and first fiscal package impacted the stock returns significantly, the first case reported, second fiscal package, vaccination drive and the second wave failed to create a commendable impact. The event analysis also suggests that the Indian stock market responds negatively to an increase in interest rate uncertainty. Our empirical analysis shows evidence of significant effect of investor sentiment on stock returns during all periods, except the period of extreme volatility. Moreover, the stock return is positively related to oil price and negatively related to the exchange rate. We also find mixed evidence of COVID-19 related information on stock market.",

By using post-hoc estimator approach of Lubotsky & Wittenberg (2006), we construct an efficient indicator for risk of default, by using sample of 252 US non-financial corporate data (2000-2010). On average, our results validate that almost 48% of change in yield spread is explained by default risk especially in recent financial crisis period (2007-2009).

To verify the usability of our model and explore the driving factors of price dynamics, we conduct a thorough empirical analysis for 786 large-tick stocks traded on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange. Empirical results statistically demonstrate that aggressive orders can introduce stronger impact on the NPC than cancelations. Meanwhile, splitting a big order into several small orders can lead to a larger NPC. Our framework can also be applied for the prediction of price change.",

        "abstract": "The standard measures of distress risk ignore the fact that firm defaults are correlated and that some defaults are more likely to occur in bad times. We use risk premium computed from corporate credit spreads to measure a firm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s exposure to systematic variation in default risk. Unlike previously used measures, the credit risk premium explicitly accounts for the non-diversifiable component of distress risk. In contrast to prior findings in the literature, we find that stocks with higher systematic default risk exposures have higher expected equity returns which are largely explained by the Fama\u00e2\u0080\u0093French risk factors. We confirm the robustness of these results by using an alternative systematic default risk factor for firms that do not have bonds outstanding.",

Specifically, we investigate performance persistence amongst small portfolios of past high-performing funds. In contrast to the more common analysis of decile portfolios of funds, we focus on persistence in the more extreme positive tail of the cross section of fund performance. This paper contributes to the smaller literature on UK rather than US mutual fund performance. We investigate fund persistence based on practitioner index models as well as academic factor models, focusing on small portfolios of funds using inference based on nonparametric persistence test statistics as well as conventional t tests. We provide strong evidence of positive persistence amongst small-size portfolios of (past) high-performing funds that is robust to alternative formation and holding periods and alternative performance models. We also document some sensitivity in inferences on positive persistence when using nonparametric versus conventional tests.",

We assume that there are two classes of investors who trade long-lived assets by holding constantly rebalanced portfolios based on their beliefs. Provided beliefs, and thus portfolios, are sufficiently diversified, all investors survive in the long-run and, due to waves of mispricing, the resulting equilibrium returns exhibit long-term reversal. If, moreover, asset dividends are positively correlated, investors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 profitable trades become positively correlated too, thus generating short-term momentum in equilibrium returns. We use the model to replicate the performance of the Winners and Losers portfolios highlighted by the empirical literature and to provide insights on how to improve upon them.

We find support for this hypothesis as total, active, and passive mutual fund ownership are negatively related to the degree of price clustering.

Anticipating that informed traders are more likely to submit market buy (sell) orders when asset is significantly under (over) valued, uninformed traders tend to chase market buy (sell) orders of the informed to buy (sell). To gain from the order chasing of the uninformed, informed traders strategically submit more market buy (sell) and limit sell (buy) orders. This amplifies the order chasing behaviour of the uninformed, generating predictable trading behaviours that can improve information efficiency but reduce market liquidity. Order book information and learning can have opposite effects on order choices and endogenous liquidity provision for the informed and uninformed. Furthermore, more informed trading is beneficial, but fast trading can be harmful for market quality.",

Conversely, in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, LINK, FTX, and Theta transitioned from transmitters to net receivers. In the Terra Luna crash, LINK remained a primary net receiver. During the FTX crash, FTX, Binance Coin (BNB), Maker (MKR), LINK, and Synthetix (SNX) consistently operated as major net receivers.

Using a empirical measure of brand capital stock constructed from advertising expenditures accounting data, we show that: (i) firms with low brand capital investment rates have higher average stock returns than firms with high brand capital investment rates, a difference of 5.2% per annum; (ii) more brand capital intensive firms have higher average stock returns than less brand capital intensive firms, a difference of 5.1% per annum; and (iii) investment in both brand capital and physical capital is volatile and procyclical. A neoclassical investment-based model in which brand capital is a factor of production subject to adjustment costs matches the data well. The model also provides a novel explanation for the empirical links between advertising expenditures and stock returns around seasoned equity offerings (SEO) documented in previous studies.

We utilize both the univariate and multivariate Ordinary Least Square (OLS) regression analysis to test the future monthly and quarterly stock return. We apply the unit root test to test the stationary of the time series, and various diagnostic tests to check for the robustness of model. We find that the financial ratios and the capital gain have a positive relationship with expected monthly and quarterly stock return. Although not all the model show significant relationship between the financial ratios and stock return, it is proven that the financial ratios and capital gain have some predictive power to predict the Malaysia future stock return. From the overall findings, we can suggest that both the univariatre DY with dummy variable and multivariate DY model with dummy variable are the good models to predict the Malaysia monthly and quarterly future nominal stock return.",

        "abstract": "One puzzling result in the literature on the linkages between the spot and futures crude oil prices is the sensitivity of causality tests to the sample period that one considers, which is usually handled by sample splitting. In order to overcome this difficulty, we propose a model that allows time-varying Granger causality between these prices. The model is used to investigate the time-varying causal linkages between the daily spot and futures prices for maturities of one, two, three and four months of the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil benchmark over the period January 2, 1986\u00e2\u0080\u0093July 31, 2013. The results indicate that the causal links between these oil prices are strongly time-varying. Both variables have a predictive power for each other during various subperiods, but not in all periods. Further, these periods coincide with major influential changes in the oil and stock markets and the geopolitics, implying that the findings are not statistical artifacts, but reflect real economic, financial and geopolitical regime changes. The full sample's conditional Granger causality tests based on the Markov-switching vector-error correction (MS-VEC) model reject both the causal impact of the lagged futures prices on the spot prices and the causal impact from the lagged spot prices on the futures prices. Therefore, the results show that the lead\u00e2\u0080\u0093lag relationship between the spot and futures oil markets exists only temporarily. While encompassing the previous findings, they also offer new insights into the nature of the lead\u00e2\u0080\u0093lag relationships between the spot and futures oil markets by taking non-linearity and time-variation into account.",

Moreover, higher volume leads to higher order imbalances. These findings are consistent with well-established empirical findings.

As jumps mark the arrival of new information to the market, we explore the contribution of jumps in reducing the informational asymmetry. We identify jumps using a combination of jump detection techniques. For all maturities, the trading activity is more informative in the proximity of jumps. For the 2- and 5-year maturities, there is a lower level of information asymmetry before the jump, followed by a high level during the jump window and up to 20 minutes after the jump occurs. Thus, the incorporation of new information in prices is not instantaneous but several transactions are needed for the market to completely acknowledge the new information. Finally, we propose the use of the estimated integrated volatility as an exogenous predictor of jump occurrence in addition to announcement surprises.",

In this study, we compare the financial properties of these new digital assets and investigate their dynamic relationship with major financial securities and commodities. Furthermore, we evaluate the economic and financial potential benefits of cryptocurrencies for financial investors. Using different time-varying copula approaches and bivariate dynamic conditional correlation GARCH models, we find that the cross-correlation with conventional assets is changing over time but weak, supporting the idea that these cryptocurrencies can be suitable for financial diversification. However, our analysis of portfolios shows that cryptocurrencies are poor hedging instruments in most of the considered cases. Moreover, we find that the relationship between cryptocurrencies and conventional assets is sensitive to external economic and financial shocks.",

This mission is more difficult to accomplish when trading activity is associated with financial instability in the form of intraday price jumps. While the literature has widely shown that exogenous news releases trigger these jumps, very little is known about the consequences of endogenous technical trading on market instability. Using high-frequency 5-min data on 460 NASDAQ stocks from February to September 2017, we provide new evidence that sharp price movements during the day are also triggered by technical trading around special market configurations. When technical trading activity dominates, intraday price jumps are detected more frequently, and their direction becomes significantly predictable, particularly in small caps and in the energy sector. Our results support the view that the explanations for intraday market instability are not limited to news releases.",

We cast our approach in a Bayesian framework and assume that market agents update their beliefs to incoming signals based on a prior information set. By exploiting the distribution rather than the time-series properties of information signals, our method is able to construct univariate signal-specific, but also composite proxies of information loss, with the latter being more efficient in reducing misleading effects and interpretation errors. As an empirical illustration, we construct information loss proxies for the US equity market from several mainstream information signals and find that the majority of information loss indicators can influence investors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 attention, which then intermediates the impact of information signals on market outcomes. Finally, we show that, by relying on composites rather than univariate proxies, market agents can diversify and thus reduce their information losses when interpreting signals associated with the same underlying event.",

We developed a systematic crisis identification methodology that takes into account both, the magnitude and the speed of price deterioration and apply it to a unique dataset, that includes realized returns and sector positions of CTAs on a daily basis. We find CTAs do acquire positive gains in most sectors during crises, which originate from two sources: Firstly, their diversification across multiple futures markets, i.e. positive yields in gaining markets can counterbalance low performance in the crisis market. Secondly, the fast reduction in CTAs' exposure to crisis markets (in less than 15 days for composite indices) allows them to stabilize their performance. Both factors together, quickly cutting losses in crisis sectors while staying profitable in the other ones, allow CTAs to generate crisis alpha.",

Recent work has considered directional spillovers or links between oil and equity markets. In recent times there has been a growing body of research into the impacts of news and media attention on asset returns, both in the context of and in particular with both the oil and equity markets but also within each of these. This paper considers how news or information flows about crude oil influence the spillover links between these assets. Using realized volatility estimates based on high frequency data, the empirical analysis reveals a number of novel results in terms of the behavior of these linkages. Increased news flow about oil reduces the impact of the broader equity market on the oil sector, implying that it is driven more by oil specific shocks and less by more general financial market conditions. It also increases the impact of the oil sector on the broader equity market. These results have potential implications for hedging and portfolio allocation.",

We derive the asymptotic distribution of the statistics under the null hypothesis that simple gross returns are unpredictable after a constant mean adjustment. This represents a test of the weak form of the Efficient Market Hypothesis. We also consider the multivariate extension, in particular, we derive the restrictions implied by the EMH on multiperiod portfolio gross returns.

        "abstract": "Investors do arbitrage between bonds and stocks. The so-called \u00e2\u0080\u009cFed model\u00e2\u0080\u009d asserts that comparing the level of the earnings yields of stocks to the nominal government bond yields is relevant when assessing the relative values of the two asset classes, and their prospective returns. A conceptual problem with this model is that it compares a real quantity, the earning yield, to a nominal one, the government bond yield, thus implying that economic agents suffer from money-illusion. The merits of the Fed model as an indicator of stock returns is still very controversial. In this article we try to quantify the scope of the Fed model by employing appropriate techniques of co-integration to validate, or invalidate, the Fed model. More precisely, we study the validity of the model geographically and using different frequencies in order to determine its potential time horizon. We obtain the following results. First, the Fed model is very limited in scope and in time: of the 21 pairs of countries and stock exchange indices tested, only three are potential candidates for the Fed model: the US, Italy and Mexico; in the US, the Standard and Poor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 500 confirms the model, but only from 1980 to 2000. Second, for the Standard and Poor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 500 from 1980 to 2000 the validity of the Fed model is confirmed, for a time horizon of one week or more for predicting the earning yield on stocks and a time horizon of one month or more for the nominal yield on bonds. Third, from 2000 onwards the long-term relationship between earning yields and nominal bond yields becomes inverted, and the Fed long-term relationship does not help predict any of the two variables compared to a simple vector autoregressive model (VAR). Overall, the evidence for the relevance of a linear long-term relationship between nominal US bonds yields level and the earnings ratio of broad stock indexes appears very weak, even when this relationship is allowed to vary over time, with a structural break somewhere in 2000 with an inversion of the relationship. In most cases, assuming and estimating a possible long-term relationship between earning yields and nominal bond yields does not improve the forecasts as short-term dynamics dominate.",

We proxy for negative and positive investor sentiments using the Google Search Volume Index for terms related to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and COVID-19 vaccine, respectively. Using weekly data from March 2020 to May 2021, we document significant relationships between positive and negative investor sentiments and stock market returns and volatility. Specifically, an increase in positive investor sentiment leads to an increase in stock returns while negative investor sentiment decreases stock returns at lower quantiles. The effect of investor sentiment on volatility is consistent across the distribution: negative sentiment increases volatility, whereas positive sentiment reduces volatility. These results are robust as they are corroborated by Granger causality tests and a PVAR model. The findings may have portfolio implications as they indicate that proxies for positive and negative investor sentiments seem to be good predictors of stock returns and volatility during the pandemic.",

Using a Markov-switching vector autoregressive model, we show that stock markets were mainly influenced by their own shocks, with effects that were sensitive to regime shifts. Connectedness network analysis reveals that gold and stock markets were net contributors (receivers) of spillovers in the low-volatility regime (high-volatility regime), while oil was a major receiver (contributor) of spillovers in the low-volatility regime (high volatility regime). Regimes were mainly low-volatility from January 2019 to February 2020 and high-volatility from March 2020 to May 2020. We conclude that the COVID-19 pandemic intensified spillovers from commodity markets to the US and Chinese stock markets.",

As investors may herd towards a specific factor, sector or style to combat market conditions for optimizing investment returns, examining such herding can reveal investors' risk profiles. We employ State-Space models for extracting time series of herd dynamics and the proportion of signal explained by herding (PoSEH). The possibility of a leverage effect between market returns and volatility and its implications are discussed. The change in market volatility strengthens PoSEH; its impact is maximum on high return days of stocks. Quantile regression analysis shows that herding and adverse herding can emerge during the worst and best performance days of stock returns, but extreme uncertainty can bring both herding behaviours to a near halt. The study reveals the presence of a regulated stock market environment and the change in volatility and risk-aversion as the determinants of herding behaviour.",

A categorization of the durations allows us to reformulate the PH model as an ordered response model based on extreme value distributed errors. In order to capture persistent serial dependence in the duration process, we extend the model by an observation driven ARMA dynamic based on generalized errors. We illustrate the maximum likelihood estimation of both the model parameters and discrete points of the underlying unspecified baseline survivor function. The dynamic properties of the model as well as an assessment of the estimation quality is investigated in a Monte Carlo study. It is illustrated that the model is a useful approach to estimate conditional failure probabilities based on (persistent) serial dependent duration data which might be subject to censoring structures. In an empirical study based on financial transaction data we present an application of the model to estimate conditional asset price change probabilities. Evaluating the forecasting properties of the model, it is shown that the proposed approach is a promising competitor to well-established ACD type models.",

Two parametric GARCH-type jump models which explicitly incorporate both news arrival and news sentiment variables are proposed, among which one assumes news affecting financial markets through the jump component while the other postulating the GARCH component channel. In order to give the most-likely format of the interactions between news arrival and stock market behaviors, these two models are compared with several other easier versions of GARCH-type models based on the calibration results on DJIA 30 stocks. The necessity to include news processes in intraday stock volatility modeling is justified in our specific calibration samples (2008 and 2013, respectively). While it is not as profitable to model jump process separately as using simpler GARCH process with error distribution capable to capture fat tail behaviors of financial time series. In conclusion, our calibration results suggest GARCH-news model with skew-t innovation distribution as the best candidate for intraday returns of large stocks in US market, which means one can probably avoid the complicatedness of modelling jump behavior by using a simplier skew-t error distribution assumption instead, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s necessary to incorporate news variables.",

When long-term volatility is high, stock returns are more sensitive to news, and there is a pronounced asymmetry in the response to good and bad news. We explain this by combining the Campbell-Shiller log-linear present value framework with a two-component volatility model for the conditional variance of cash flow news and allowing for volatility feedback. In our model, innovations to the long-term volatility component are the most important driver of discount rate news. Large announcement surprises lead to upward revisions in future required returns, which dampens/amplifies the effect of good/bad news.",

We find significant differences in news composition depending on the communication channel used by central banks. Non-monetary news prevails in about 40% of policy decision announcements by the Fed and the ECB, and this fraction is even higher for communications that provide context to policy decisions such as press conferences.

        "abstract": "Many practitioners point out that the speculative profits of institutional traders arc eroded by the difficulty in gauging the price impact of their trades. In this paper. we develop a model of strategic trading where speculators face such a dilemma because of incomplete information about time-varying market liquidity. Unlike the competitive market makers that they trade against, informed traders do not know whether the liquidity ( \"noise\") trades are generated from a distribution with high or low variance. Instead, they have to learn about liquidity from past prices and trading volume. Extreme price deviations from forecasts of fundamentaIs based on public news or low trading volume tend to lead to revisions of beliefs in favor of the low liquidity state. This revision in beliefs implies that strategie trades and market statistics such as informational efficiency arc path-dependent on past market outcomes. Our paper has a number of normative implications for practitioners concerned with gauging the potential price impact of their trades.",

The reason is that, in good times, less desirable assets with low average cash flows and high loading on market risk perform similar to more desirable assets with high average cash flows and low market risk, rendering them difficult to distinguish. However, their relative fundamental performance diverges in downturns, enabling better inference. Consistent with these predictions, stocks' reaction to earnings news is up to 70% stronger in downturns than in upturns.",

Further, we assess the downside and upside short- and medium-run risk spillovers from oil to U.S. exchange rate returns and vice versa by computing the conditional Value-at-Risk (CoVaR) risk measures. Before the copula estimations, we apply the spillover index of Diebold and Yilmaz (2012) and network diagrams to identify and select the currencies that are the most significant net contributors or net receivers of returns from/to the oil/currency markets. The copula results show strong evidence of time-varying and high average (tail) dependence between oil returns and the FX markets, which are net transmitters to oil, for the short and medium time horizons. On the other hand, we find average and relatively low dynamic dependence between oil and the net receiver currencies, regardless of the time horizons. Moreover, there is evidence of up and down risk asymmetric systemic risks from oil to currencies and vice versa for some countries in the short-and medium run horizons. Finally, the risk spillovers are asymmetric over time and investment horizons. These results have several important implications for hedging strategies and diversification benefits for oil and FX traders and institutional investors.",

Sorting stocks on the difference between low- and high-frequency betas (\u00ce\u0094\u00ce\u00b2) yields large systematic mispricings relative to the CAPM at high frequencies, but significantly smaller mispricings at low frequencies. We provide a risk-based explanation for this frequency dependence by introducing uncertainty about the effect of systematic news on firm value (opacity) into a frictionless model. We document a robust relationship between the frequency dependence of betas and proxies for opacity. Our findings suggest that opacity poses significant challenges to using betas estimated from high-frequency returns. While the CAPM may be an appropriate asset pricing model at low frequencies, additional factors, e.g., based on opacity, are necessary at high frequencies.",

        "abstract": "This paper examines the efficiency of the S&P 500 options market by testing the martingale properties of the Model-Free Forward Variance (MFFV) time series using the Generalized Spectral Test (GST). Based on a sample from January 1, 1996 to May 31, 2010, our tests show robust evidence that the S&P 500 options market is not efficient. By examining the subsamples before and after the 2008 financial crisis, we find this options market inefficiency is mainly driven by the outbreak of the subprime crisis. Our diagnostic tests further indicate that this inefficiency is due to the skewness-in-mean effect of forward variance. Specifically, the skewness-in-mean effect is weakened once we account for the S&P 500 index jump effects. Hence, we can establish a link between jumps and options market inefficiency. Finally, we find that the lagged skewness of the forward variance can help forecasting the forward variance both in-sample and out-of-sample. The economic significance of this forecasting ability is further highlighted by the performance of a trading strategy based on forward variance. In sum, out study provides robust evidence and a trading implication on testing the S&P 500 options market efficiency.",

Furthermore, it analyzes the upside and downside short- and long-run risk spillovers between oil and stock markets by quantifying three market risk measures, namely the value at risk (VaR), conditional VaR (CoVaR) and the delta CoVaR (\u00e2\u0088\u0086CoVaR). The results show that there is a tail dependence between oil and all stock markets for the raw return series. By considering time horizons, we show that there is an average dependence between the considered markets for the short-run horizons. However, the tail dependence is also found for the long-run horizons between the oil and stock markets, with the exception of the S&P500 index which exhibits average dependence with the oil market. Moreover, we find strong evidence of up and down risk asymmetric spillovers from oil to stock markets and vice versa in the short-and long run horizons. Finally, the market risk spillovers are asymmetric over the time and investment horizons.",

We find, consistent with the Melitz (2003) model, that larger, more export-oriented firms experienced larger stock market losses in the wake of European trade restriction announcements. We further show that European trade policy had a larger negative effect on Chinese private sector firms relative to state owned enterprises.

We use a multivariate generalized heteroskedasticity in mean model to estimate 25 portfolios that are formed on size and the book-to-market ratio. Each portfolio is allowed to have its own no-arbitrage condition. We find that although the conditional covariances of returns with consumption exhibit negative variation across size, they do not vary across the book-to-market ratio. Thus, C-CAPM can capture the size effect, but not the value effect. The fit is, however, improved by allowing the coefficients on the consumption covariances to be different. The value effect appears to be associated with the book-to-market ratio as well as size. On its own the book-to-market ratio does not generate additional information about average returns to C-CAPM. A possible explanation for these findings is that both small and low book-to-market ratio firms are expected to have higher rates of growth.",

In our model, informed traders strategically trade against competitive market makers to exploit their short-lived private information. Unlike market makers, informed traders do not know whether the liquidity ('noise') trades are generated from a distribution with high or low variance. Instead, informed traders have to learn about liquidity from past prices. We find the following. (1) Prices that deviate markedly from the forecast of terminal asset value based on public news tend to lead to revisions of informed traders' beliefs in favour of the low liquidity state. (2) This revision in beliefs results in less aggressive trading on private information by informed traders. (3) In turn, informational efficiency and trading volume are dependent on the path of prices.

We find evidence of herding towards the market portfolio in both bull and bear markets.

The linear tests show a cyclical pattern in linear dependence suggesting that the Indian stock market switched between periods of efficiency and inefficiency. However, the results from nonlinear tests reveal a strong evidence of nonlinearity in returns throughout the sample period with a sign of the taping magnitude of nonlinear dependence in the recent period.

The evidence supports the rational expectation hypothesis.

Further, we find banking, financial services and auto sectors are the most prominent in transmitting the objective of the monetary policy.

The suggested method takes into account responses to the changing nature of financial markets and allows for the possibility of observing negative interest rates. Our approach enables to find particular values of switching points between alternative regimes. After showing main theoretical steps, an investigation of the dependence of such points on key parameters of bonds is provided. An empirical illustration follows, accompanied by a discussion of theoretical and practical effects of this bond property. This approach offers both theorists and interested practitioners a way of overcoming difficulties associated with computations because of the complicated theoretical background. The results can be generalised, so that they apply both to the life of a bond and to the behaviour of a portfolio of bonds at a point of time.",

Instead, we find that the capacity of an industry to lead the market is significantly moderated by proxies for investor attention. In general, more neglected industries are more informative in leading the markets due to delayed investor attention to the information content of these industries; and the information contained in industry portfolio returns is incorporated into the market return more slowly during economic recession when investors pay less attention to the stock markets.

In that, conventional time series analysis often fails to give an accurate forecast for financial processes due to inherent noise patterns, fat tails, and nonlinear components.

Consequently, the application of technical analysis in trading could produce high returns. Machine learning techniques have been employed in economic systems in modeling nonlinearities and simulating human behavior. In this study, we expand the literature that evaluates return sign forecasting ability by introducing a recurrent neural network approach that combines heuristic learning and short-term memory emulation, thus mimicking the decision-making process of boundedly rational agents.

The advantage of the FDR over existing methods is that it selects more outperforming rules, which allows diversifying against model uncertainty. Persistence tests show that, even with the more powerful FDR technique, an investor would never have been able to select ex ante the future best-performing rules. Moreover, even in-sample, the performance is completely offset by the introduction of low transaction costs. Overall, our results seriously call into question the economic value of technical trading rules that has been reported for early periods.",

The best assets to acquire information about are ones the investor expects to hold. But the assets the investor holds depend on the information he observes. We build a framework to solve jointly for investment and information choices, with a variety of preferences and information cost functions. Although the optimal research strategies depend on preferences and costs, the main result is that the investor who can first collect information systematically deviates from holding a diversified portfolio. Information acquisition can rationalize investing in a diversified fund and a concentrated set of assets, an allocation often observed, but usually deemed anomalous.",

Our empirical results show that the trading strategy exhibits abnormally large returns, confirming the existence and persistence of a mispricing. The aggregate returns of the trading strategy are positively related to the square of market-wide credit and liquidity risks, indicating that the mispricing is more pronounced when the market is more volatile.

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a new double-question survey method that elicits information about how individuals.subjective belief valuations are compared and related to their price expectations. An individual respondent is presented with two sets of questions, one that asks about his/her belief regarding the value of an asset (whether it is over- or under-valued), and another regarding his/her expectations of the future price of that asset. Responses to these two questions are then used to measure the extent to which prices are likely to move towards or away from the subjectively perceived fundamental values. Using a theoretical asset pricing model with heterogenous agents we show that there exists a negative relationship between the agents expectations of price changes and their asset valuation. Double question surveys on equity, gold and house prices provide evidence in support of such relationships, particularly in the case of house price expectations. The effects of demographic factors, such as sex, age, education, ethnicity, and income are also investigated. It is shown that for house price expectations such demographic factors cease to be statistically significant once we condition on the respondents. location and their asset valuation indicator. The results of the double-question surveys are then used to construct leading bubble and crash indicators, and their potential value is illustrated in the context of a dynamic panel regression of realized house price changes across a number of key Metropolitan Statistical Areas in the US.",

A related question is whether two parallel emerging markets offering more or less the same securities but using different institutional designs, can behave as a single, fully integrated market. In this paper we introduce an explicit model of price convergence (with transaction costs), in which price differences are studied using levels of arbitrage activity. For the empirical analysis we use two parallel markets in the Czech Republic 97 the Prague Stock Exchange (PSE) and the RMS (over-the-counter system). In particular, we study the degree of arbitrage activity for different segments of the PSE and the evolution of arbitrage in the early history of these emerging markets. The empirical results provide evidence of market linkage for actively traded stocks. We find a significant relationship between the segment of the market to which a given firm belongs and the estimated level of arbitrage trading. Moreover, the level of arbitrage activity increases over time for all market segments, and, as the markets mature, the differences among the segments gradually disappear.",

Sub-sectors such as Energy Management, Recycling, and Water consistently serve as risk transmitters, while Wind and Geothermal absorb risks, emphasizing heterogeneous roles within the sector. This high level of interconnectedness limits the ability to reduce risks within the clean energy sector alone during turbulent times. Policy interventions, such as subsidies and regulatory support for critical risk-transmitting sub-sectors, could stabilize the market and reduce systemic vulnerabilities. Sectors like Solar and Smart Grid adapt to market conditions, taking on different roles depending on crisis-specific factors, particularly in response to energy security and sustainability policies.

Differences of opinion resulting from interpretation of complex language appear to result in more trading volume despite relatively low levels of liquidity (a negative liquidity-volume relationship), while large target rate surprises reduce trading activity (a positive liquidity-volume relationship). The dynamic changes over time, as unconventional polices are adopted by monetary authorities and, high frequency traders become more pervasive.

Our inquiry elucidates distinctive patterns by employing empirical analyses utilizing quantile connectedness and Time-Varying Parameter Vector Autoregressive (TVP-VAR) methodologies.

Notably, digital assets manifest heightened volatility in contrast to traditional and energy indices. Furthermore, our findings underscore that the gaming industry, specifically focusing on Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT), presents itself as the most fitting asset for portfolio inclusion. This assertion gains credence from its comparatively lower degree of connectedness with other underlying assets.

Our results show that realized variance, skewness, and relative jumps strongly predict stock returns around earnings announcements but realized kurtosis does not. These findings are robust to various event windows, after controlling for firm characteristics, and to a range of additional tests. We further show that the predictability of realized measures is not affected by unexpected earnings. The findings also suggest that pre-announcement realized measures absorb part of the information contained in unexpected earnings.",

Furthermore, we also show that dollar-denominated returns often indicate a better fit than regressions in local currency suggesting that international capital inflow does play an important role in asset prices.

We find that when the dividends are negatively correlated, ETFs reduce asset mispricing without decreasing market activity (turnover).

Anchoring as a heuristic bias causes investors to focus on recent price changes and price levels, which leads to a belief in continuing trend and mean-reversion, respectively. The empirical results support our theoretical explanation through an analysis of large price fluctuations in the S&P 500 and the resulting effects on implied and realized volatility. These results indicate that asymmetry (a negative relationship) between shocks and volatility in the subsequent period indeed exist. Moreover, contrary to previous research, our empirical tests also suggest that implied volatility is not simply an upward biased predictor of future deviation compensating for the variance of the volatility but rather, due to investors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 systematic anchoring to losses and gains in their volatility forecasts, a co-integrated yet asymmetric over-/under-estimated financial instrument. We also provide results indicating that the medium-term implied volatility (measured by the VIX Index) is an unbiased though inefficient estimation of realized volatility, while in contrast short-term volatility (measured by the recently introduced VXST Index representing the 9-day implied volatility) is also unbiased and yet efficient.",

We demonstrate that unexpected changes of survey forecasts and their dispersion significantly affect cyclical factor returns in a dynamic setting and that the state of the economy matters for the magnitude, persistence, and occasionally also for the sign of the effect. Second, by extending the dynamic asset pricing model of Adrian et al.

Implied volatility is a market determined forecast, in contrast to model-based forecasts that employ some degree of smoothing to generate forecasts. Therefore, implied volatility has the potential to reflect information that a model-based forecast could not. Specifically, this paper considers two issues relating to the informational content of the S&P 500 VIX implied volatility index. First, whether it subsumes information on how historical jump activity contributed to the price volatility, followed by whether the VIX reflects any incremental information relative to model based forecasts pertaining to future jumps. It is found that the VIX index both subsumes information relating to past jump contributions to volatility and reflects incremental information pertaining to future jump activity, relative to modelbased forecasts. This is an issue that has not been examined previously in the literature and expands our understanding of how option markets form their volatility forecasts.",

        "abstract": "Published in the Journal of Reviews on Global Economics (2013). Volume 2, pages 307-329.Economists and financial analysts have begun to recognise the importance of the actions of other agents in the decision-making process. Herding is the deliberate mimicking of the decisions of other agents. Examples of mimicry range from the choice of restaurant, fashion and financial market participants, to academic research. Herding may conjure negative images of irrational agents sheepishly following the actions of others, but such actions can be rational under asymmetric information and uncertainty. This paper uses futures position data in nine different markets of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to provide a direct test of herding behaviour, namely the extent to which small traders mimic the positions of large speculators. Evidence consistent with herding among small traders is found for the Canadian dollar, British pound, gold, S&P 500 and Nikkei 225 futures. Consistent with survey-based results on technical analysis, the positions are significantly correlated with both current and past market returns. Using various time-varying volatility models to accommodate conditional heteroskedasticity, the empirical results are found to be robust to alternative models and methods of estimation. When a test of causality-in-variance is used to analyse if volatility among small traders spills over into spot markets, it is found that spillovers occur only with Nikkei 225 futures. The policy implications of the findings are also discussed.",

        "abstract": "Evidence suggests that rational, periodically collapsing speculative bubbles may be pervasive in stock markets globally, but there is no research that considers them at the individual stock level. In this study we develop and test an empirical asset pricing model that allows for speculative bubbles to affect stock returns. We show that stocks incorporating larger bubbles yield higher returns. The bubble deviation, at the stock level as opposed to the industry or market level, is a priced source of risk that is separate from the standard market risk, size and value factors. We demonstrate that much of the common variation in stock returns that can be attributable to market risk is due to the co-movement of bubbles rather than being driven fundamentals.",

We formulate an optimal execution strategy that minimizes the trading fees charged by the exchange. We further provide a proof for the existence of an optimal execution strategy for this type of fee schedule. The optimal strategy involves both market and limit orders on various price levels. The optimal order distribution scheme depends on the market conditions expressed in terms of the distribution of limit order execution probabilities and the exchange\u00e2\u0080\u0099s specific configuration of the fee schedule. Our results indicate that a strategy kernel with an exponentially decaying allocation of trade volume to price levels further away from the best price provides superior performance and potential reduction of trade execution cost of more than 60%. The robustness of these results is confirmed in an empirical study. To our knowledge, this is the first study of optimal trade execution that takes into consideration the full fee schedule of exchanges in general.",

We demonstrate that unexpected changes of survey forecasts and their dispersion significantly affect cyclical factor returns in a dynamic setting and that the state of the economy matters for the magnitude, persistence, and occasionally also for the sign of the effect. Second, by extending the dynamic asset pricing model of Adrian et al. (2015), we show that GDP forecasts and their dispersion are priced in the cross section and drive the size and value premium, whereas inflation expectations serve as robust predictors for the price of risk. We also document that the survey expectations-augmented specification reduces pricing and premium errors when compared to a common benchmark of return predictors.",

Volatility and spreads increase right after ECB monetary policy decisions, but market expectations of the interest rate changes were relatively precise during the sample period. Main refinancing operations with the open market are associated with active liquidity re-allocation, little volatility and no signs of market power or adverse selection. Spreads and volatility were high at the end of the reserve maintenance periods and during the year 2000 changeover.

We find that the mean, volatility, skewness, and kurtosis spillover effects exist and the components of those effects have not changed over time in 2002-2006. In sum, we conclude that the KOSPI and S&P 500 move together during the sample period. The conclusion, however, is weakened once we modified the data by excluding the opening price of KOSPI since we only find the volatility spillover effect during the same period. Therefore, we can conclude that the opening price of Korean stock market may reflect new information that occurred overnight in foreign markets so that moment dependencies or moment spillover effects are weakened between Korean and U.S. stock market.",

However, it is only recently that authors have focussed on differentiating between, and learning from, how investors react to good and bad news. In this paper we find that investors swing between being optimistic and being pessimistic in their interpretation of the new information driven by not only the prevailing market uncertainty and sentiment but also by a significant number of firm-specific characteristics. Pessimism prevails when uncertainty is high, sentiment is weak and the information is being disseminated by companies that are lowly-valued, have high risk, are thinly traded and/or are small cap stocks. However, investors swing to being optimistic when one reverses some or all of these factors.

We derive conditions for information disclosure to be the equilibrium strategy and solve for the equilibrium.When both traders are risk-neutral they each increase their profits by specializing in the types of information they acquire. This specialization encourages the traders to share information directly or through trades. When the traders have different risk preferences, the more risk averse trader may prefer to reveal his less precise information in order to stimulate information production by less risk averse traders.

It helps traders to learn a statistical equilibrium in which traders' expected payoffs and out-sample payoffs are highly correlated.

        "title": "New Testing Procedures to Assess Market Efficiency with Trading Rules",
        "abstract": "This paper presents two computational techniques and shows that these techniques can improve tests for market efficiency based on profit of trading rules. The two techniques focus on interval estimates for expected profit per trade, in contrast to the standard approach that emphasizes point estimates for profit per trade (Daskalakis, 2013; Marshall, Cahan, & Cahan, 2008). The first technique uses confidence intervals to determine if the expected profit is significantly different from zero. The second technique uses moving-window resampling, a procedure of drawing sub-samples that overlap and move incrementally along a time series, to determine if the expected profit is sensitive to sample selection. The paper develops formal testing criteria based on each technique and uses simulation to establish existence results about the tests for efficiency: the standard approach can give false negative results and the new tests can give correct negative or correct positive results. Using a random walk, I show situations where the standard approach incorrectly determines that a market is inefficient whereas the new techniques do not make this error; the standard approach can be fooled by randomness of profit. Using a mean reverting process and a trading rule designed to exploit mean reversion, based on Bollinger bands, I show that the new techniques can correctly recognize an inefficient market. Since the new testing procedures can correctly identify an efficient or inefficient market, with an error rate discussed in the paper. These results support Fama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s (1970) position that trading rules can form the basis for the theory of efficient markets. This definition of an efficient market in terms of trading profit is timely given the current dominance of algorithmic trading in secondary markets.",

For instance, when the measure indicates positive (negative) information, out-of-the-money calls (puts) generate returns of 27% (32%) over roughly four weeks.

The aim of this research is to provide for a better understanding of some of these linkages by conducting an empirical investigation of the channels underlying the risk of contagion between real estate (i.e., REITs) and financial markets in the United States. We test for three financial mechanisms driving contagion: Information correlation, liquidity correlation, and portfolio rebalancing. A behavioral dimension in the crisis propagation is also examined by considering investor sentiment and panic risk in our analyses. A methodology based on quantile regressions and copulas is utilized for carrying out those tests. We find that contagion prevails between real estate and financial markets and that this is driven by behavioral and liquidity mechanisms. The correlated information and portfolio rebalancing hypotheses are strongly rejected. The results of this research should prove useful to investors seeking to hedge against market crashes as well as to policy makers who aim to mitigate such stressful episodes.",

It covers data from 11 euro area countries from January 1, 2007 to August 31, 2017 and distinguishes between the more solvent countries (Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands) and the less solvent ones (Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain). The paper makes three contributions to the literature. First, it is the first paper to reveal that measurable effects of announcements arise with a one-day delay meaning that government bond markets take some time to react to ECB announcements. Second, it quantifies the country-specific extent of yield reduction which seems inversely related to the solvency rating of the corresponding countries. The reduction of the spread between both groups in response to an event is due to a stronger decrease in the less solvent group. Third, this result is confirmed by letting the announcement variable interact with the spread level, which is an innovation in this strand of literature. By employing different data as control variables, it turns out that the results are robust for a given event set.",

Herding is the deliberate mimicking of the decisions of other agents. Examples of mimicry range from the choice of restaurant, fashion and financial market participants, to academic research. Herding may conjure negative images of irrational agents sheepishly following the actions of others, but such actions can be rational under asymmetric information and uncertainty. This paper uses futures position data in nine different markets of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to provide a direct test of herding behaviour, namely the extent to which small traders mimic the positions of large speculators. Evidence consistent with herding among small traders is found for the Canadian dollar, British pound, gold, S&P 500 and Nikkei 225 futures. Consistent with survey-based results on technical analysis, the positions are significantly correlated with both current and past market returns. Using various time-varying volatility models to accommodate conditional heteroskedasticity, the empirical results are found to be robust to alternative models and methods of estimation. When a test of causality-in-variance is used to analyse if volatility among small traders spills over into spot markets, it is found that spillovers occur only with Nikkei 225 futures. The policy implications of the findings are also discussed.",

However, some empirical evidence suggests that commodity prices can predict monetary policy. In this way, there is an endogeneity between commodity prices and monetary policy. Using Frankel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s model we include a Taylor rule equation in this theoretical model, which let us analyze the endogeneity problem. In order to find empirical support of this model, we estimate SVAR and, using quarterly data from 1962:Q1 to 2009:Q1, we find that the overshooting of commodity prices to 1% increase of real interest rate can be a minimum of 2.86% and a maximum of 5.97% depending on the chosen model. The increase of real interest rate given a 1% increase in commodity prices is positive and significant but of small magnitude (0.20% - 0.05%).",

We can take account of Grexit news generally and, also, distinguish news items according to individual country press, domestic political leaders, supranational executives and institutions.

Thus, speculations about Grexit seem to be confined to more vulnerable economies.

        "abstract": "We provide new evidence on the relationship between bilateral trade and stock market performance over Asia-Pacific region. Using three regional blocs in Asia-Pacific region -- the Far Eastern bloc, the Chinese bloc, and the Australian bloc, we examine two main questions: whether trade linkages between countries affect stock returns of trading partners and whether stock markets of trading partners are interdependent. By incorporating two distinct dynamic properties of regime shifting and cointegration in intra-regional trade and stock market index, we employ a newly suggested multi-variable smooth transition autoregressive vector error correction model (STAR-VECM). A series of STAR-based tests reveals the evidence that bilateral trade significantly Granger-causes stock returns in Asia-Pacific region with the effect varying over regime changes. Among three blocs, Far Eastern bloc displays the most pronounced complementary relationship between trade growth and stock returns compared to other blocs. We also find evidence of stock market synchronization within each region.",

        "abstract": "We analyze the impact of US macroeconomic surprises and forecaster heterogeneity on the USD/EUR exchange rate and US and German long-term interest rates from 1999 to 2014. We show how a direct proxy of macroeconomic disagreement, given by the heterogeneity of beliefs among forecasters regarding the upcoming macroeconomic release, matters to explain the daily and intra-day movements. Surprises impact more strongly long-term yields and the exchange rate when forecaster heterogeneity is smaller. This result, holds for the main US macroeconomic surprises and is robust to the frequency of the data used in the estimation. However the sensitivity changes with the sample. To this end, we show how estimating the same regressions in a pre-crisis period, a crisis period, and an unconventional monetary policy period there is evidence of time variation in the responses: unconventional monetary policies attenuated the response of the exchange rate to US\\ macroeconomic news, while no major change occurred for long-term interest rates in the US and in the euro area. The disagreement regimes remain relevant in determining an asymmetric response of these asset prices. Our finding underscores the importance of considering beliefs heterogeneity to describe the behavior of asset prices even at high frequency.",

        "abstract": "We analyze the reaction of the U.S. Treasury bond market to innovations in macroe-economic fundamentals. We identify these innovations based on macroeconomic news, which are defined as differences between the actual releases and market expectations. We find that that macroeconomic news explain about one-third of the low frequency (quarterly) fluctuations in long-term bond yields. When we focus on the high frequency (daily) movements, this decrease to one-tenth. This is because macroeconomic news have a persistent effect on bond yields, whereas non-fundamental factors have substantial effects on the day-to-day movements of bond yields, although their effects are shorter lived.",

The inclusion of HML improves mainly the fit of the low book-to-market portfolios, SMB, and HML that are not correctly priced in the standard C-CAPM. Consumption premium varies across size and coincides with the size effect. The effect of a HML premium is to reduce the amount of consumption premium, implying that low book-to-market ratio and, to a lesser degree, small portfolios are not as risky as consumption predicts. The HML premium across size is contradictory to the size effect as small firms have a larger negative HML premium.",

To understand how these variables influence future bond excess returns, we decompose excess returns into expected and unexpected excess returns. Expected returns crucially depend on the available information set which is spanned by order flow, forward rates and macroeconomic variables. Thus, the predictability of bond excess returns stems from the strong linkage of expected excess returns to available economic information and order flow. The analysis of unexpected excess returns reveals contemporaneous order flow and changes of the economic environment as main drivers.",

Using daily stock market prices from the Shanghai-Shenzhen, New York and Hong Kong markets, we calculate abnormal returns to several policy changes affecting solar panels produced in China. We find, consistent with the Melitz (2003) model, that larger, more export-oriented firms experienced larger stock market losses in the wake of European trade restriction announcements. We further show that European trade policy had a larger negative effect on Chinese private sector firms relative to state owned enterprises. Finally, we use a two stage least squares estimation technique to show that firms listed on US markets are more responsive to news events than those listed in China and Hong Kong.",

        "abstract": "This article presents a new approach for building robust portfolios based on stochastic efficiency analysis and periods of market downturn. The empirical analysis is done on assets traded on the Brazil Stock Exchange, B3 (Brasil, Bolsa, Balcao). We start with information on the assets from periods of market downturn (worst-case) and we group them using hierarchical clustering. Then we do stochastic efficiency analysis on these data using the Chance Constrained Data Envelopment Analysis (CCDEA) model. Finally, we use a classical model of capital allocation to obtain the optimal share of each asset. Our model is able to accommodate investors who exhibit different risk behaviors (from conservatives to risky investors) by varying the level of probability in fulfilling the constraints (1-\u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00b1i) of the CCDEA model. We show that the optimal portfolios constructed with the use of information from periods of market downturns perform better for the Sharpe ratio (SR) in the validation period. The combined use of these approaches, using also fundamentalist variables and information on market downturns, allows us to build robust portfolios, with higher cumulative returns in the validation period, and portfolios with lower beta values.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a new double-question survey method that elicits information about how individuals subjective belief valuations are compared and related to their price expectations. An individual respondent is presented with two sets of questions, one that asks about his/her belief regarding the value of an asset (whether it is over- or under-valued), and another regarding his/her expectations of the future price of that asset. Responses to these two questions are then used to measure the extent to which prices are likely to move towards or away from the subjectively perceived fundamental values. Using a theoretical asset pricing model with heterogenous agents we show that there exists a negative relationship between the agents expectations of price changes and their asset valuation. Double question surveys on equity, gold and house prices provide evidence in support of such relationships, particularly in the case of house price expectations. The effects of demographic factors, such as sex, age, education, ethnicity, and income are also investigated. It is shown that for house price expectations such demographic factors cease to be statistically significant once we condition on the respondents location and their asset valuation indicator. The results of the double-question surveys are then used to construct leading bubble and crash indicators, and their potential value is illustrated in the context of a dynamic panel regression of realized house price changes across a number of key Metropolitan Statistical Areas in the US.",

We rely on twenty-four measures of market liquidity divided into eight groups. Each group either represents direct trading costs, which refer to the spread estimates (tightness), or indirect trading costs, which span the price impact estimates (depth and resilience). The weights assigned to the different groups are time-varying and depend on three components: the correlation between groups, the liquidity pressure conveyed through the measures in the group, and their conditional variance. Our liquidity index succeeds in tracking the most important historic episodes of financial stress. Moreover, it shows the expected macroeconomic and financial relationships mentioned in the literature, and has some predictive power for future growth rates. Finally, our methodology can gauge the individual importance of each liquidity group over time. Our results show that price impact measures receive higher weights during tranquil periods, while spread estimates play a prominent role during periods of financial distress.",

Complex statements are more difficult to interpret and may be construed in different ways by different agents. This creates heterogeneity of beliefs among market participants that manifests in increased market activity. We introduce novel measures of linguistic complexity (readability and word count) for the FOMC statements that accompany monetary policy decisions. The empirical evidence shows that monetary policy surprises have a significant impact on financial markets, and clearly demonstrates that more complex language significantly increases the trading volume, and volatility of returns, in stock, bond, and currency markets. We also establish that financial markets are more responsive to monetary policy decisions (and the language of those statements) during recession.",

The research framework delineates seven primary themes that underpin this study: market efficiency, behavioral finance, technical analysis, volatility, fractals, asset pricing, and price discovery. For practitioners, investors, and policymakers, our study presents evidence regarding emerging themes, such as technical analysis, adaptive market hypothesis, and machine learning, which diverges from the findings of the proponents of equilibrium models based on investors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 rationality.
