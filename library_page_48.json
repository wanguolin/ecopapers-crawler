            "abstract": "Shorting flows remain a significant predictor of negative future stock returns during 2010\u00e2\u0080\u00932015, when daily short-sale volume data are published in real time. This predictability decays slowly and lasts for a year. Long-term shorting flows are more informative than short-term shorting flows. Indeed, abnormal short-term shorting flows do not predict future returns or anticipate bad news. We find that short sellers exploit prominent anomalies. A comparison with the Regulation SHO data indicates that the predictability is much shorter-term during 2005\u00e2\u0080\u00932007. Short sellers appear to have shifted from trading on short-term private information to trading on long-term public information that is gradually incorporated into prices.",

We find that analysts do not fully use the information in anomaly signals when making recommendations. Analysts tend to give more favorable consensus recommendations to stocks classified as overvalued and, more important, these stocks subsequently tend to have particularly negative abnormal returns. Analysts whose recommendations are better aligned with anomaly signals are more skilled and elicit stronger recommendation announcement returns. Our findings suggest that analysts\u00e2\u0080\u0099 biased recommendations could be a source of market friction that impedes the efficient correction of mispricing.",

            "abstract": "Investors are reluctant to trade in the high-information-asymmetry days before earnings announcements. We show that the decrease in liquidity trading before announcements is asymmetric. We analyze buy and sell orders of investors with passive investment strategies, and find they do not reduce their sales as much as their purchases in the days before announcements. Investors needing liquidity sell stocks at a discount relative to the post-announcement price, and these preannouncement liquidity sales are a significant driver of the average positive returns, or return premium, known to characterize announcement days.",

I confirm the model\u00e2\u0080\u0099s empirical predictions by estimating the effect of the publication of the weekly change in oil inventories on liquidity via a difference-in-differences strategy. The bid-ask spread of stocks related to oil doubles after the release and their volume increases by 32% regardless of the report\u00e2\u0080\u0099s surprise. Further, consistent with the model, implied volatility drops and insider\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trading increases after the report\u00e2\u0080\u0099s publication.",

Our findings indicate that stock returns are counterseasonal. Specifically, a long-short strategy of buying low-sales season stocks and shorting high-sales season stocks produces an annual alpha of 8.4% (14.5% over the last decade). This seasonal effect has a relatively high Sharpe ratio and occurs independently of previously documented seasonal anomalies. We analyze several possible hypotheses for this phenomenon.",

On the other hand, explanations based on investors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 lottery preferences and market frictions show some promise in explaining the puzzle. Together, all existing explanations account for 29\u00e2\u0080\u009354% of the puzzle in individual stocks and 78\u00e2\u0080\u009384% of the puzzle in idiosyncratic volatility-sorted portfolios.

Strategies long (short) stocks with positive (negative) lagged jump returns earn significantly positive returns over the next one- to three-month horizons. The results based on intraday jumps, especially overnight jumps, provide further evidence consistent with underreaction. The underreaction is robust to controlling for other firm characteristics, extends stock return momentum over intermediate to short horizons, and captures market underreaction to information shocks beyond earnings surprises. We further show that limited investor attention contributes to short-term underreaction.",

It outperforms substantially the well-known short-term reversal, momentum, and long-term reversal factors, which are based on the three price trends separately, by more than doubling their Sharpe ratios. During the recent financial crisis, the trend factor earns 0.75% per month, while the market loses \u00e2\u0088\u00922.03% per month, the short-term reversal factor loses \u00e2\u0088\u00920.82%, the momentum factor loses \u00e2\u0088\u00923.88%, and the long-term reversal factor barely gains 0.03%. The performance of the trend factor is robust to alternative formations and to a variety of control variables. From an asset pricing perspective, it also performs well in explaining cross-section stock returns.",

            "abstract": "We document strong weekly lead-lag return predictability across stocks from different industries with no customer-supplier linkages (economically unrelated stocks). Between 1980 and 2010, the industry-neutral long-short hedge portfolio earns an average of over 19 basis points per week. This predictability is related to common institutional ownership and is distinct from previously documented lead-lag effects. Common institutional ownership is a complementary rather than a substitute explanation for return predictability. Information linkages are enough to induce return predictability among stocks in the same industry, but economically unrelated stocks exhibit return predictability only when they have common institutional owners. Our findings suggest that institutional portfolio reallocations can induce return predictability among otherwise unrelated stocks.",

In our model, speculators assess the novelty of their information based on recent price movements, and market makers are aware that speculators might be trading on stale news. An asymmetric response to past price movements ensues: after price increases, buy volume \u00e2\u0080\u0093 because it may result from stale news trading \u00e2\u0080\u0093 has a lower price impact than sell volume (and vice versa after price decreases).

We begin with a flexible set of prior beliefs that can be elicited without any reference to probability distributions or their parameters. We then combine these prior beliefs with a general multi-factor model and derive an analytical solution for the posterior expectation of alpha', the intercept term from the model. This solution can be computed using only a few extra steps beyond maximum likelihood estimation and does not require a comprehensive or bias-free database. We then apply our methodology to a sample of domestic diversified equity mutual funds and ask what prior beliefs would imply zero investment in active managers?' To justify such a zero-investment strategy, we find that a mean-variance investor would need to believe that less than 1 out of every 100,000 managers has an expected alpha greater than 25 basis points per month. Overall, our analysis suggests that even when the average manager is expected to underperform passive benchmarks, it requires very strong prior beliefs to imply zero investment in managers with the best past performance.",

We use them as a hedging tool for developed currency markets. We further investigate the key drivers of frequency spillovers, before and during COVID-19, and the property of precious metals as a hedge and safe haven against currency risk exposure. We performed the quantile coherency analysis and found that the dependence is positive among the currencies and negative between currencies and precious material in most cases. Using the time-frequency spillovers analysis, we show that gold and silver are net transmitters of spillover to the other markets; however, palladium is a net receiver of spillover for all three horizons. The EUR is a net contributor of risk regardless of the time horizon. Using the quantile regression model, we demonstrate that the effect of the West Texas Intermediate crude oil price (WTI), Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU) index, volatility index (VIX), and USD index (USDX) on total spillover varies over quantiles in terms of magnitude and direction. Finally, we show that all precious metals can be used as a strong hedge against these major currencies.",
