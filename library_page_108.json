The portafolio theory saysthat the conformation of efficient portafolio has to combine assets of different risk to getthe maximun expect profit, taking on account that it can exist correlation between thereturns of the assets. This paper seeks evidence about the correlation between the maingroup of the assets on the local market and assets on the internacional markets. Theassets on the local market (stocks, currencies, treasury bonds) and the internacionalmarkets (partucularly treasuries) has to show hight correlations to be consider substitutein the construction of efficient portafolio. To prove this evidence, it is used twometodologies (Hodrick and Prescott filter (1997) and the first difference of thevariables) to check the contemporary and no contemporary correlations between thereturns of local and international assets. The evidence shows that the correlationbetween these two types of assets is low, and is not allow take a conclusion about thismatter.",

            "title": "The Predictive Ability and Profitability of Moving Average Rules in the Saudi Stock Market",
            "abstract": "Following the implementation of capital market reforms, Saudi Arabia has opened up its stock market to international investors. This liberalisation has led to the inclusion of the stock exchange into leading global indices, which is expected to lead to an influx of foreign investment. Thus, it is important and timely to examine the efficiency of the Saudi stock market. To that end, this paper conducts a comprehensive investigation of the predictive ability and profitability of a popular trading rule, the moving average rule, using firm-level data for the Saudi stock market over the period 1st January 2008 to 31st December 2017. The results show that the moving average rule has predictive ability; the active rules for a majority of the sample companies outperformed the corresponding passive strategy. Furthermore, the results were economically significant as the rules were profitable even after the consideration of transaction costs. The results also showed that the most profitable moving average rules were those with short-moving average lengths, and that the introduction of a bandwidth, which serves to eliminate weak trading signals, had a positive impact on rule profitability. Importantly, the analysis showed that the most profitable component of the rule related to short selling as these trades resulted in higher profits than the long positions. A disaggregated analysis of sectors showed that the trading rules outperformed the buy-and-hold strategy in all seven industries considered, while the analysis of covariance revealed the importance of careful selection of filter size. Overall, the analysis documents significant inefficiencies in the Saudi stock market and suggests that the employment of a simple trading rule, based on past price data, can yield substantial profits across companies and sectors even in a costly trading environment. These findings suggest that the recent reforms that were implemented to improve the efficiency of the Saudi stock market have been suboptimal, and that further regulatory reform is required.",

            "abstract": "This paper analyzes intraday transactions in the Korean stock market to investigate the impact of policy signals - statements of the authorities about the future direction of monetary policy - on returns, volatility and trading volume(trading value) in the stock market. The stock market responds not only to change of the overnight call target rate but also to pronouncements indicating the future monetary policy stance. The impact is largest just before and just after policy signals, which suggests that the stock market moves efficiently to incorporate its expectations of monetary policy in pricing and transaction behavior. Stock market volatility increases around the time of monetary policy announcements, yet regular announcements act as a factor making for reduced volatility. This result implies that stock market volatility can be reduced by making regular announcements. Foreign investors show different patterns in their trading response to monetary policy announcements to those of individual and domestic institutional investors. Finally, in relation to the impact of the characteristics of individual issues on the stock market, the riskier and the smaller a company is, the greater the degree of volatility of its stock price.",

Using the uncertainty surrounding the negotiation and ratification process of the Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement of 1989 (CUSFTA), I estimate the impact of different types of tariff reductions on the abnormal returns of Canadian manufacturing firms. I find that Canadian import tariff reductions lead to lower, and reductions in Canadian intermediate input tariffs to higher abnormal returns. The impact of U.S. tariff reductions is less clear and depends on the size of the affected firms. I also calculate the total profit increase implied by my estimates. Overall, CUSFTA increased per-period profits by around 1.2%. This was mainly driven by intermediate input tariff reductions which more than offset the negative effect of Canadian import tariff reductions.",

            "abstract": "We investigate whether short sellers are subject to the disposition effect using a novel dataset that allows to identify the weekly closing of short positions. Consistent with the disposition effect, the closing of short sale positions is strongly related to a proxy of Shortsale Capital Gains Overhang (SCGO). Furthermore, while short sellers in general exhibit skill in closing their positions ? i.e. closing is followed by positive stock returns ? the closing explained by SCGO is followed by negative returns. This suggests that the trades are irrational and caused by the disposition effect. Next, we study the implications of short sellers? disposition effect on stock prices. We provide evidence that SCGO is negatively related to future stock returns. This effect exists after controlling for the standard effect of capital gains overhang of other market participants. A trading strategy based on SCGO achieves yearly three-factor alphas of up to 26%. Overall, our results suggest that short sellers, instead of arbitraging away the mispricing caused by the disposition effect of the other market participants, add to this mispricing due to their own behavioral biases.",

            "abstract": "This paper presents novel empirical evidence on key predictions of heterogeneous firm models by examining stock market reactions to the Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement of 1989 (CUSFTA). Using the uncertainty surrounding the agreement's ratification, I show that the pattern of abnormal returns of Canadian manufacturing firms was broadly consistent with the predictions of a class of models based on Melitz (2003). Increases in the likelihood of ratification led to stock market gains of exporting firms relative to non-exporters. Moreover, gains were higher in sectors with larger cuts in U.S. import tariffs. Decreases in the likelihood of ratification led to opposite stock market reactions. Results for the impact of Canadian tariff reductions are less conclusive but most specifications suggest that exporters also gained relative to non-exporters in response to such reductions. Translating stock market gains into implied profit changes, I find that CUSFTA increased expected per-period profits of exporters by around 6-7% relative to non-exporters.",
