            "abstract": "Abstract This study investigates possible existence of predictable components in stock excess returns in eighteen European countries i.e. Austria, Croatia, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Russia, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and United Kingdom. The excess return series for these countries are modeled using non Gaussian state space or unobserved component model that encompasses non normality and time varying volatility that might be present in the series. While statistically significant evidence of non-normality and volatility persistence does exist in most series, statistically significant persistent predictable component also prevails in Austria, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland excess returns. However, the results on possible existence of predictable components in stock excess returns in Croatia, Denmark, Greece, Hungary, Russia, Slovakia, and United Kingdom are in sharp contrast. The efficiently estimated excess returns range between 0.002 % per month for Slovakia to 0.094 % per month for Russia stock excess returns. The characteristic exponent ranges between of 1.632 for Croatia to 1.917 for France showing non-normal behavior in these series although the characteristic exponent of 1.999 shows a normal behavior in Italian and Russian excess return series.",

            "abstract": "Abstract This study investigates the time-varying and frequency spillovers between G7 stock markets and uncertainty indices of strategic commodities (oil and gold), as well as their implications for diversified portfolios. The results show, using Barun\u00c3\u00adk and K\u00c5\u0099ehl\u00c3\u00adk (J Financ Econom 16:271\u00e2\u0080\u0093296, 2018) method, significant time-varying spillovers between the series under study. Moreover, spillover size is more important during an oil collapse than during other crises (GFC, G2 trade tension, and COVID-19, among others). Short-term spillover is the largest proportion of total volatility spillovers. Furthermore, the uncertainty indices are net receivers of spillovers for different time horizons. Oil receives more spillovers than gold, indicating that the latter commodity is more immune to shocks emanating from G7 stock markets than the former. The G7 stock markets, apart from that of the Japanese, are net transmitters of spillovers in the system.",

            "abstract": "Equity returns are typically assumed to be drawn from a normal distribution. However, empirical research suggests that this assumption does not generally hold true. Such deviations from normality allow investors to either prefer or avoid higher moments, which can lead to potential inefficiency in stock prices. This study extends the literature by testing whether deviations from normality inhibit the efficiency of stock prices. We find that both positive and negative skewness impedes price efficiency. We also find that excess kurtosis is associated with informationally inefficient prices.",

            "abstract": "Abstract A properly performing and efficient bond market is widely considered important for the smooth functioning of trading systems in general. An important feature of the bond market for investors is its liquidity. High-frequency trading employs sophisticated algorithms to explore numerous markets, such as fixed-income markets. In this trading, transactions are processed more quickly, and the volume of trades rises significantly, improving liquidity in the bond market. This paper presents a comparison of neural networks, fuzzy logic, and quantum methodologies for predicting bond price movements through a high-frequency strategy in advanced and emerging countries. Our results indicate that, of the selected methods, QGA, DRCNN and DLNN-GA can correctly interpret the expected bond future price direction and rate changes satisfactorily, while QFuzzy tend to perform worse in forecasting the future direction of bond prices. Our work has a large potential impact on the possible directions of the strategy of algorithmic trading for investors and stakeholders in fixed-income markets and all methodologies proposed in this study could be great options policy to explore other financial markets.",

            "abstract": "Abstract This study investigates how the lockdowns during the COVID-19 outbreak affect the multifractal features of four Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) (i.e., Cryptokitties, Cryptopunks, SuperRare, and Decentraland) using daily price data ranging from 23 June 2017 to 15 February 2022. The major concern is to assess whether the presence of herd investing and the level of market inefficiency altered for the period between pre-first-lockdown (i.e., 23 June 2017\u00e2\u0080\u009322 March 2020) and post-first-lockdown (i.e., 23 March 2020\u00e2\u0080\u009315 February 2022). The generalized Hurst exponents are measured towards a multifractal detrended fluctuation approach. In particular, the empirical results document that multifractality exists for each NFT during the COVID-19 outbreak. Besides, the level of market inefficiency differs among the selected NFTs. The results refer to the case that the post-first-lockdown period is more prone to herd investing for Cryptokitties, Cryptopunks, and Decentraland. Furthermore, testing for MLM (inefficiency) index, the empirical findings show that Cryptokitties became more vulnerable in the post-first-lockdown period. Regarding the impacts of this far-reaching outbreak, the highest MLM (inefficiency) index value is attributed to Cryptopunks before the first lockdown and Cryptokitties after the first lockdown periods.",

Using intraday data on the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TSE), in conjunction with piecewise ordered probit regressions, we find that a significant \u00e2\u0080\u0098inverted-N\u00e2\u0080\u0099 (\u00e2\u0080\u0098N\u00e2\u0080\u0099) shape pattern is discernible on the sell (buy) side of the relationship between order aggressiveness and price distance, which is consistent with the heating effect of upper (lower) price limits, as well as a cooling-off effect of lower (upper) price limits for market sellers (buyers). This study is the first to analyze changes of market participants\u00e2\u0080\u0099 order aggressiveness when approaching price limits. Our findings offer clear indications to policymakers that price limits could counteract irrational stock markets.",

            "abstract": "Abstract How does the market react when more or fewer investors are allowed to trade certain stocks? Stock Connect, a cross-border investment channel between mainland China and Hong Kong, provides a natural testing ground. Investors are allowed to trade a list of qualified stocks from the stock market on the other side, and when a stock is removed from the list, investors can only sell but cannot buy that stock. We find that the inclusion of stocks is correlated with abnormal returns, implying downward-sloping demand curves for stocks. The effect weakens over time and disappears in about 40 trading days. There are no abnormal returns when stocks are removed from the list. On the other hand, when investors can only sell some stocks, they have a significantly higher propensity to sell. Their trading style becomes more contrarian for such stocks, and they tend to trade in small amounts. After 6 months, their investment behavior returns to that before the removal.",

            "title": "U.K. Stock Market Inefficiencies and the Risk Premium",
            "abstract": "The stock market predictability has been a favorite topic of scholars and practitioners alike. It seems that some small predictability is present in all major stock markets worldwide. This predictability can be attributed to the risk premium structure and/or to inefficiencies present in the markets. This paper investigates the predictability of returns of some major shares listed in the London Stock exchange, using economic as well as accounting variables. We first measure the predictability of these variables by regressing individual stock returns on their corresponding accounting variables and the economic ones. Second, we estimate for the returns a seasonal latent factor model with time varying volatility. Provided that our measure of risk is an adequate one, the residuals of this estimation are free of the predictability of risk premium, and consequently one expects that any accounting and factor economic variables would have no predictive power. An LM-type test is developed and employed to indicate that indeed the U.K. stock market predictability is due to the risk premium structure, and the explanatory power of the variables considered here is due to them being an approximation of risk. However, when we perform the test jointly for all assets, we reject the zero predictability hypothesis at 5% but not at 1%.",
