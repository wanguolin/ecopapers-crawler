            "title": "How do commodity futures respond to macroeconomic news?",
            "abstract": "This paper investigates the impact of seventeen US macroeconomic announcements on two broad and representative commodity futures indices. Based on a large sample from 1989 to 2005, we show that the daily price response of the CRB and GSCI commodity futures indices to macroeconomic news is state-dependent. During recessions, news about higher (lower) inflation and real activity lead to positive (negative) adjustments of commodity futures prices. In contrast, we find no significant reactions during economic expansions. We attribute this asymmetric response to the state-dependent interpretation of macroeconomic news. Our findings are robust to several alternative business cycle definitions.",

            "abstract": "This paper tries to examine the behaviour of the Romanian stock market from the point of view of financial contagion from the global world market. For realizing this study our analysis is based on 3 states MS-VAR model from 1997 to 2012, and our results suggest that no real contagion effect can be identified on the Romanian market during the financial crisis, only comovement due to integrated markets. The linkage between the Romanian and the world market is time-varying, from no dependence in can evolve towards a durable relationship in times of medium and high volatility. Even if the Romanian stock market is only mildly integrated with the world market, this level is enough to erase the benefits of international portfolio diversification.",

We found that the authorization of bond issues given by the SVS (Superintendencia de Valores y Seguros) produced no significant abnormal returns, and that the authorization of equity issues given by the SVS produced a significant and negative abnormal return. We also found that the magnitude of the negative abnormal return was directly related to the relative size of the equity issue.",

            "abstract": "We analyze the asymmetric behavior of fund managers with short-selling constraints under different market conditions to confirm the hypothesis of difference of opinion of fund managers and also investigate determinants in difference of opinions in fund market. This paper examines two issues: whether there exists the difference of opinions of fund managers and whether there is asymmetric volatility under short-sale constraints. Under short-sale constraints, we implement testing the hypothesis of difference of opinion found by Chen, Hong, and Stein (2001) and Hong and Stein (2003). This hypothesis provides a unique opportunity to test directly the differences of opinion among fund managers that operate under short-sale constraints using asset-allocating strategies. The test results provide evidence that there is asymmetric volatility and increased differences of opinion among fund managers. Furthermore, the results of this study are consistent with the model of Hong and Stein (2003), which predicts that negative asymmetries are more likely to occur when there are large differences of opinions among fund managers. Therefore, our results imply that the overvaluation effect is more remarkable in funds for which a wider dispersion of the opinions of fund managers exists. These findings are consistent with Miller\u00e2\u0080\u0099s (1977) intuition and Hong and Stein\u00e2\u0080\u0099s (2003) model. In addition, our results also support the stochastic bubble hypothesis and are consistent with Blanchard and Watson (1982) and Wu (1997), even after controlling for fund characteristic variables.",

The present study extends the existing literature concentrating on the degree of underpricing over a 3-month period lasting from the listing date to the 3-month anniversary showing significant evidence of IPO underpricing. The analyses support the investors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 sentiment and underwriters\u00e2\u0080\u0099 prestige hypothesis but not ex-ante uncertainty. The EBA technique has been used to examine fifteen explanatory variables of IPO underpricing. The study finds that the aftermarket risk level of the IPO, the oversubscription ratio, the offer price, the return on assets, post issue promoters\u00e2\u0080\u0099 holding and size of the firm are six robust determinants of IPO underpricing.",

Intraday patters in FX seem of particular interest as more and more trades in the FX market are automated high frequency trades (HFT). The study reveals that the mean reversion is present in the intraday EURUSD. ADF test rejects unit root. The average of the deviation of EURUSD from its (moving) mean is close to zero. Furthermore when short and long positions are simultaneously open, the average maximum return achieved through 24 hour period is similar, providing yet another evidence for mean reversion and lack of weak form of market efficiency.",

The following main research hypothesis was verified: public disclosure of information about an arrangement conclusion and acceptance in restructuring proceedings results in above-average rates of return due to investments in the stocks of these entities in the short term. Three events were assessed: the public disclosure of information about the conclusion of a debtor\u00e2\u0080\u0093creditor arrangement (Event 1), its approval by a court (Event 2), and the decision becoming final (Event 3). The research method applied was the event study. Event 1 and Event 3 leads to an above-average and statistically significant increase in stock prices on the day of the event. In contrast, no statistically significant above-average rates of return accompanied Event 2.",

We find that for most of the individual stock returns the coefficients of the turn-of-the-month effect are all positive indicating the presence of the turn-of-the-month effect. When the data is pooled, we obtain even stronger results. The study confirms that the turn-of-the-month effect holds for Macedonian Stock Exchange which has not been examined before. Therefore, on average, the daily return over the turn-of-the-month effect period is significantly higher than the daily return over the rest-of-the-month period and hence providing room for more investment opportunities.",

            "abstract": "In this thesis we deal with different topics in financial mathematics, that are all related to market imperfections and to the fundamental technique of utility maximization. The work consists of three parts. In the first one, which is based on two papers, we consider the problem of optimal investment on a financial market with proportional transaction costs. We initially study the investment problem in the case where the utility function is multivariate (which is particularly suitable on currency markets) and the agent is endowed with a random claim, which can be interpreted as an option or another derivative contract. After analyzing the properties of the primal and dual problems, we apply those results to investigate, in this context, some aspects of a popular pricing technique in incomplete markets, i.e. utility indifference evaluation. In the second contribution to the transaction costs literature, we investigate the existence problem for a set of prices (called shadow prices) that would provide the same maximal utility to the agent if the market did not have frictions. These results shed some light on the link between the classical theory of frictionless markets and the quickly growing literature on transaction costs. In the second part of this thesis we consider the utility indifference pricing problem in incomplete markets, where the source of incompleteness comes from the fact that some assets in the market cannot be actively traded, which is the case for example in the framework of structural models for electricity prices. We provide a BSDE characterization for the price under mild assumptions, and then focus on the case of European claims by establishing in particular the existence of an optimal hedging strategy even when the claim presents discontinuities and is possibly unbounded. In the last contribution we analyze a simple principal-agent problem in finite time horizon, where the principal is mainly interpreted as a regulator and the agent as a firm producing some kind of polluting emissions. We separately treat both the agent's and the principal's problems and use the BSDE theory for providing necessary and sufficient conditions for optimality. We also perform some sensitivity analyses and give numerical results in order to provide a better understanding of the agents' behavior.",
