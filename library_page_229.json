            "abstract": "We present a model where quantitative trading \u00e2\u0088\u0092 trading strategies based on the quantitative analysis of prices, volumes, and other asset and market characteristics \u00e2\u0088\u0092 is systematically profitable for sophisticated traders whose only source of private information is knowing better than other market participants how many fundamental traders, i.e., traders informed about fundamentals, are active in the market. In equilibrium, the direction of optimal quantitative trading depends on the number of fundamental traders and often switches sign when order flow increases: with few fundamental traders, optimal quantitative trading is trend-following (re. contrarian) after small (re. large) price changes; with many fundamental traders, the opposite holds: it is contrarian (re. trend-following) after small (re. large) price changes.",

            "abstract": "The capital asset pricing model (CAPM) performs poorly overall, as market risk (beta) is weakly related to 24-h returns. This is because stock prices behave very differently with respect to their sensitivity to beta when markets are open for trading versus when they are closed. Stock returns are positively related to beta overnight, whereas returns are negatively related to beta during the trading day. These day-night relations hold for beta-sorted portfolios and individual stocks in the US and internationally as well as for industry and book-to-market portfolios and cash flow and discount rate beta-sorted portfolios. In addition to the change in slope of returns with respect to beta, the implied risk-free rate differs significantly between night and day. Consistent with this, returns on US Treasury futures differ significantly between night and day.",

            "abstract": "We study a natural experiment in which 1.5 million investors participate in allocation lotteries for Indian IPO stocks. Investors who win the lottery and obtain IPO stocks that rise in value increase portfolio trading volume in non-IPO stocks relative to lottery losers; the effects are negative for lottery winners obtaining IPO stocks that fall in value. A model in which agents learn from random experience about their ability to operate in the market environment best explains the results. Investors who have received multiple past IPO allocations show smaller responses, suggesting that learning/selection moderates these responses to noise shocks.",

            "abstract": "Academic studies show that technical trading rules would have earned substantial excess returns over long periods in foreign exchange markets. However, the approach to risk adjustment has typically been rather cursory. We examine the ability of a wide range of models: CAPM, quadratic CAPM, downside risk CAPM, Carhart\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 4-factor model, the C-CAPM, an extended C-CAPM with durable consumption, Lustig-Verdelhan (LV) carry-trade factor model, and models including macroeconomic factors, and foreign exchange volatility, skewness and liquidity, to explain these technical trading returns. No model plausibly accounts for much of the technical profitability. This failure implicitly supports non-risk based explanations such as adaptive markets.",

            "abstract": "Crude oil is one of the most important commodities in the real economy and as such the relationship between oil prices and broader equity markets has attracted a lot of research attention. Recent work has considered directional spillovers or links between oil and equity markets. In recent times there has been a growing body of research into the impacts of news and media attention on asset returns, both in the context of and in particular with both the oil and equity markets but also within each of these. This paper considers how news or information flows about crude oil influence the spillover links between these assets. Using realized volatility estimates based on high frequency data, the empirical analysis reveals a number of novel results in terms of the behavior of these linkages. Increased news flow about oil reduces the impact of the broader equity market on the oil sector, implying that it is driven more by oil specific shocks and less by more general financial market conditions. It also increases the impact of the oil sector on the broader equity market. These results have potential implications for hedging and portfolio allocation.",

News creates a substantial shift in the joint distribution of stock and exchange rate returns that has both a transitory and a persistent component.

Our statistic is based on actual returns rather than logarithmic returns and is therefore better suited to capturing price predictability. It captures not only linear dependence in the same way as the variance ratio statistics of Lo and MacKinlay (1988) but also some nonlinear dependencies. We derive the asymptotic distribution of the statistics under the null hypothesis that simple gross returns are unpredictable after a constant mean adjustment. This represents a test of the weak form of the Efficient Market Hypothesis. We also consider the multivariate extension, in particular, we derive the restrictions implied by the EMH on multiperiod portfolio gross returns. We apply our methodology to test the gross return predictability of various financial series.",

On the emerging market the interdependency between these measures strengthen as the stock market matures. Since 2008 the aggregate liquidity measures from both markets behave similarly suggesting that commonality in liquidity is strongly affected by the global risk factors. Although the transaction costs on both markets show similar dynamics, on the emerging market they are significantly higher. Both volatility and spreads induce an increase in trading activity. Higher volatility influences spreads.",

            "abstract": "There is no doubt that politicians exert a significant impact on stock markets. The evolving financial market volatility over the United States presidential election is a prime example of how elections have an impact on financial markets. This study assessed whether BRICS stock markets were equally vulnerable to Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s agenda using event-study methodology and regression-based intention votes over a period of 120 days toward the final election result on 08 November 2016. It was shown that although Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s win had a negative effect on some markets, it had a positive effect on others. It had the most adverse impact on China together with Brazil. Although not to the same degree as these two countries, India and South Africa were also affected negatively. These adverse reactions can be explained by Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s neo-mercantilist attitude, which involves cancelling trade deals and instituting tariffs. However, the effects on Russia appear to be positive due to the expectations about the easing of sanctions imposed on Russia because of the Russian role in the conflict of Ukraine.",
