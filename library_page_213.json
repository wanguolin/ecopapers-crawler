            "abstract": "We examine the return and volatility transmission between oil and US equity sectors during three periods: the pre-COVID-19 phase, COVID-19 pre-vaccination phase, and COVID-19 post-vaccination phase. We show that the return and volatility spillovers between oil and US equity sectors vary across these three phases. The highest return connectedness is observed during the post-vaccination phase. The volatility spillover is highest from the majority of sectors to oil market in the COVID-19 pre-vaccination phase. The volatility transmission from oil to US equities during COVID-19 is weak. Moreover, our optimal weights estimations suggest that investors should decrease their exposures in US equities for the portfolio of oil-equity sectors in the COVID-19 post-vaccination phase. Finally, hedging cost is lowest, and hedging effectiveness is highest during the post-vaccination phase. Our findings provide valuable insights to portfolio managers and investors regarding portfolio diversification, hedging, and forecasting during health crises and subsequent recovery phases.",

            "abstract": "We propose a new method based on Arbitrage Pricing Theory to test herding pattern. With the innovative WCSV model, we theoretically prove that this method can test strong herding patterns while filtering out weaker ones, showing better discriminating power than previous methods; also, it can detect time points that affect the overall herding level. Empirically, we apply this method to Chinese A-share market and conclude that the market turmoil of Year 2007\u00e2\u0080\u00932008 caused long-lasting herding with a decaying trend. Fama\u00e2\u0080\u0093French Three-Factor Model is proved to be an applicable underlying APT model in WCSV model with good model fitting and significant improvement compared to univariate CAPM. Also, we suggest that herding is a relative rather than absolute concept, which depends highly on the chosen benchmark.",

Using the daily data for Indian rupee, Brazilian real and South African rand against the US dollar, we find the evidence of price discovery in these currency markets. The spot market consistently leads the futures market for the Indian rupee and South African rand, however, the futures market leads the spot market for Brazilian real during the sample period. Our results further show that the cost-of-carry error correction model is the best forecasting model and a trading strategy based on this model outperforms the market even after allowing for transaction costs.",

            "abstract": "I investigate the magnitudes and determinants of volatility spillovers in the foreign exchange (FX) market, using realized measures of volatility and heterogeneous autoregressive (HAR) models. I confirm both meteor shower effects (i.e., inter-regional volatility spillovers) and heat wave effects (i.e., intra-regional volatility spillovers) in the FX market. Furthermore, I find that conditional volatility persistence is the dominant channel linking the changing market states of each region to future volatility and its spillovers. Market state variables contribute to more than half of the explanatory power in predicting conditional volatility persistence, with the model that calibrates volatility persistence and spillovers conditionally on market states performing statistically and economically better. The utilization of market state variables significantly extends our understanding of the economic mechanisms of volatility persistence and spillovers and sheds new light on econometric techniques for volatility modeling and forecasting.",

This article focuses on the most frequent uses of VIX, namely, as (1)a financial product to hedge a portfolio against volatility risk; (2)a market risk measure used to analyze risk flows from financial markets and to relate private and public risks; and (3)a volatility measure to estimate the spot volatility dynamics, the volatility risk premium and volatility jumps. This survey offers an entre for researchers who consider VIX as a proxy for volatility and/or risk.",

            "abstract": "Using data from 2003 to 2013, we examine liquidity linkages, originating with the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank (FED) reserve creation, resulting from conventional and non-conventional monetary policy. These reserves, in turn, impact commercial bank credits/lending and U.S. stock market liquidity. We find that stock market liquidity varies across different monetary policy subperiods, where liquidity is strongly influenced by changes in bank lending and M2 money velocity. FED monetary policy that results in bank reserve increases generally stimulates bank lending and subsequently, is accompanied by stock liquidity gains. These linkages were observed during the 2007\u00e2\u0080\u009309 recession and QE-1 subperiods, where increasing FED assets and bank credits were accompanied by stock liquidity increases. However, even though FED assets and excess bank reserves increased substantially during QE-2 and QE-3, we find no commensurate increases in bank lending/credits or M2 Velocity. We find that QE-2 and QE-3 had no effect or negative impacts on stock liquidity. These findings support our hypothesis that enhancements in stock market liquidity generally occur only when FED stimulus coincides with commensurate increases in bank lending. Additionally, we find positive effects of short-selling during periods of high market uncertainty, and positive effects from the FED being allowed to pay interest on excess reserves (IOER).",

            "abstract": "This paper examines the relationship between aggregate stock market sentiment and metal futures returns. Overall, metal futures have higher returns when investor sentiment is pessimistic rather than optimistic. Further analysis indicates that metal futures returns exhibit asymmetric responses to positive and negative investor sentiment shocks. Temporary and reactive demand shocks and flight to quality concerns may partially explain this asymmetry. In addition, there exists a negative predictive relationship between investor sentiment and metal futures returns, which remains persistent even after controlling for liquidity and open interest. Moreover, this predictive effect of sentiment on metal futures returns is magnified when there is high conditional volatility.",

The analysis of the stock market\u00e2\u0080\u0099s behavior supports a cautionary stance on the hypothesis of the efficient-market theory, even in its weak form. Another finding, as regards the macroeconomic consequences of stock-price development, undermined the assumption of the positive wealth effect of rising stocks. In relation to GDP growth, the prediction power of the stock index proved rather limited. The Czech stock market can also function as an instrument of portfolio diversification, at least in relative terms, since the correlation to the Czech bond market was weak. Contrariwise, the correlation among the Czech, U.S., and European stock markets increased in time, restricting the room for portfolio diversification.",

Conceptually, this indicator stems from the notion of ambiguity-averse agents in the sense of Knight. Specifically, we attempt to operationalize the incomplete preferences framework, which may allow for multiple equilibria supported by one set of fundamentals. This equilibrium indeterminacy may offer a way to reconcile short-term fluctuations of market prices with a relatively stable underlying economic environment and expectations. The method was applied to data from Central European countries, including the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia. Comparing our results with financial market opinion surveys, the results of the proposed method seems to be in accordance with market expectations.",

We argue that disequilibrium asset price is a necessary but not sufficient condition for finding a bubble in a given asset. The market and country specifics have to be borne in mind. The article also specifies the procedure for monitoring and early identification of asset price bubbles.

Results exhibit a high instability of the significant calendar effects over the various regimes up until 2001. From 2001 onwards and until the end of 2013, only a single regime across all ETFs is identified. In this last regime, results point to the disappearance of the previous significant effects across the US equity ETFs group. Unstable observed effects could have been motivated by market-specific conditions in such short time periods. The disappearance of these effects from 2001 onwards are consistent with the nature of this asset class: these ETFs are broadly diversified portfolios with diversification of private information, with higher liquidity and lower transactions cost, which is likely to reduce potential calendar effects.",
