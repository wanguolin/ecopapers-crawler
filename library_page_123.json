            "abstract": "This paper examines the efficiency of DJIM conventional and Islamic sectoral stock markets before and during the Covid-19 period. The study uses both sectoral stock markets' daily data from January 1, 2010, to August 1, 2022, and relies on the multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MF-DFA). Firstly, we find that the conventional and Islamic sectoral stock markets are multifractal in the short and long run. Secondly, conventional and Islamic sectoral stock markets are characterized by long-term memory features in small fluctuations. Thirdly, in terms of efficiency before the Covid-19 period, in the Islamic sectoral market, the healthcare sector is the most efficient in the short run, and the financial sector is the most efficient in the long run. During the Covid-19 period, in the conventional sectoral market, the financial sector was the most efficient in the short run, and the utility sector was the most efficient in the long run.",

            "abstract": "Using Consensus Economics survey data on experts\u00e2\u0080\u0099 expectations, we aim to model the 3- and 12-month ahead ex-ante risk premia on the JPY/USD and the GBP/USD exchange markets. For each market and at a given horizon, we show that the risk premium is well determined by the conditional expected variance of the change in the real exchange rate, agents\u00e2\u0080\u0099 real NMP in assets and a constant composite risk aversion coefficient, as suggested by a two-country portfolio asset pricing model. The expected variance depends on the past values of the observed variance and the unobservable real NMP is estimated as a state variable using the Kalman filter methodology. We found that the trends of our estimated horizon-specific NMPs are consistent with the ones of the observed short term aggregate NMPs calculated using the U.S. Treasury International Capital System dataset. Moreover, we show that the ex-post premia tend to adjust toward the ex-ante values, suggesting that experts\u00e2\u0080\u0099 beliefs provide a relevant information to the market. These results bring new responses to the difficulties reported by the widespread ex-post risk premium literature and enhances the usefulness of survey data in modeling the risk premium.",

            "abstract": "Although numerous studies have examined the effect of monetary policy on stock prices, empirical research in the international setting remains relatively scant. Therefore, this topic is reexamined in the context of Thailand. In a sample of 50 repurchase rate announcements of the Bank of Thailand during 2003\u00e2\u0080\u00932009, our regression results suggest that the raw change in the repurchase rate has a negative effect on stock returns at the market level, which is inconsistent with the literature. Contrary to the results of numerous studies, we find that at the market level the expected change in the repurchase rate has a negative effect on stock returns and the unexpected change in the repurchase rate exhibits no effect on stock returns. However, the effect of the unexpected change in the repurchase rate on stock returns is evident at the firm level. Our findings also suggest that the stock market's response to the repurchase rate change is asymmetric. The unexpected change in the repurchase rate that is considered as good news has a negative effect on stock returns. Overall, the evidence lends support to the notion that the monetary policy announcements have a significant effect on stock prices and further adds to the debate on whether the creditability of the monetary authority may contribute to the stock market's response to the monetary policy actions.",

            "abstract": "It is a commonly held view that gold protects investors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 wealth in the event of negative economic conditions. In this study, we test whether other metals offer similar or better investment opportunities in periods of market turmoil. Using a sample of 13 sovereign bonds, we show that other precious metals, palladium in particular, offer investors greater compensation for their bond market losses than gold. We also find that industrial metals, especially copper, tend to outperform gold and other precious metals as hedging vehicles and safe haven assets against losses in sovereign bonds. However, the outcome of the hedge and safe haven properties is not always consistent across the different bonds. Finally, our analysis suggests that copper is the best performing metal in the period immediately after negative bond price shocks.",

            "abstract": "In this paper, we revisit the idiosyncratic momentum pattern in the Chinese stock market. We show that idiosyncratic momentum strategies constructed to hedge out the risk exposures to eight popular multifactor models remain profitable. Importantly, a PLS-based idiosyncratic momentum strategy that aggregates the information contained in various idiosyncratic momentum measures consistently produces substantial profits in the cross-sectional pricing at the portfolio and individual stock levels. Furthermore, the PLS-based idiosyncratic momentum factor is helpful in explaining the cross-section of expected returns and can be rationalized in the context of Merton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s (1973) intertemporal CAPM (ICAPM) theory.",

            "abstract": "This paper uses a large sample of gold mining companies traded on four stock markets to identify different types of flight to gold. After extreme financial shocks, we observe that investors flee from stocks including gold mining shares to gold bullion. However, if the financial shock is less extreme, investors only flee from stocks excluding gold mining shares. This highlights that the study of gold mining companies provides important additional information in the context of flight to quality and safe haven effects.",

Such predictability complements that of the leading state variable\u00e2\u0080\u0094the leverage ratio\u00e2\u0080\u0094and strengthens significantly with a lower firm credit rating, longer credit contract maturity, and model-free implied variance.

We show that momentum strategies that invest in contracts on the futures curve with the largest expected roll-yield or the strongest momentum earn significantly higher risk-adjusted returns than a traditional momentum strategy, which only invests in the nearest contracts. Moreover, when incorporating conservative transaction costs we observe that our low-turnover momentum strategy more than doubles the net return compared to a traditional momentum strategy.",

Trades of each group are negatively correlated with contemporaneous price changes. To test for return predictability, we sort stocks into quintiles based on each group\u00e2\u0080\u0099s past trades and then form long-short portfolios. Stocks most heavily bought have significantly higher returns than stocks most heavily sold over the two weeks following a sort. Cross-sectional analysis shows smaller, more volatile, less actively traded, and less liquid stocks more often appear in the extreme quintiles. Time series analysis shows the long-short portfolio returns are positively correlated with a market-wide measure of liquidity. A double sort using past trades of specialists and competing market makers produces a long-short portfolio that earns 88 basis points per week (act as complements). Finally, we identify a \u00e2\u0080\u009cchain\u00e2\u0080\u009d of liquidity provision. Designated market makers (NYSE specialists) initially trade against order flows and prices changes. Specialists later mean revert their inventories by trading with competing market makers who appear to spread trades over a number of days. Alternatively, specialists may trade with competing market makers who arrive to market with delay.",

Market participants concerned about the credibility of information measures may require additional compensation to entice them to hold stocks with less transparent information. These same securities are expected to display greater sensitivities to measures of market sentiment. We find that investor sentiment sensitivities increase directly with multiple measures of opacity in the cross-section. Next we examine the extent to which sentiment sensitivities are priced in an asset pricing context. Using the Jha et al. (2009) model of conditional performance evaluation, we find an inverse relation between ex ante known investor sentiment and the marginal performance of opaque stocks. In contrast, translucent stocks exhibit relatively little variability in performance across levels of sentiment.",

We further develop statistics based on OHLC data, which separately measure upside and downside overreaction. The distribution of these statistics under the hypothesis of correct response and fundamental prices following Brownian motions is used to derive tests for upside and downside overreaction. We show that more realistic and frequently used fundamental price processes with correct response leave the distribution of the test statistics widely unaffected or lead to conservative tests. Empirical application to different stock markets provides strong evidence for intraday overreaction, particularly to bad news. The economic significance of the discrimination induced by the proposed statistics is further illustrated by analyzing the performance of a simple buy on bad news strategy.",
