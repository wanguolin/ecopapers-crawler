            "abstract": "Abstract Shannon entropy is the most common metric for assessing the degree of randomness of time series in many fields, ranging from physics and finance to medicine and biology. Real-world systems are typically non-stationary, leading to entropy values fluctuating over time. This paper proposes a hypothesis testing procedure to test the null hypothesis of constant Shannon entropy in time series data. The alternative hypothesis is a significant variation in entropy between successive periods. To this end, we derive an unbiased sample entropy variance, accurate up to the order $$O(n^{-4})$$ O ( n - 4 ) with n the sample size. To characterize the variance of the sample entropy, we first provide explicit formulas for the central moments of both binomial and multinomial distributions describing the distribution of the sample entropy. Second, we identify the optimal rolling window length to estimate time-varying Shannon entropy. We optimize this choice using a novel self-consistent criterion based on counting significant entropy variations over time. We corroborate our findings using the novel methodology to assess time-varying regimes of entropy for stock price dynamics by presenting a comparative analysis between meme and IT stocks in 2020 and 2021. We show that low entropy values correspond to periods when profitable trading strategies can be devised starting from the symbolic dynamics used for entropy computation, namely periods of market inefficiency.",

Price deviations in two major cryptocurrencies are investigated across six major cryptoexchanges. Trading in both bitcoin and ethereum has become more integrated across different cryptoexchanges since 2018. Bitcoin and ethereum spot many similarities in the behavior of price deviations for any given pair of exchanges and share similar trading dynamics on the same cryptoexchange. Returns on arbitrage trading of bitcoin and of ethereum exhibit very similar dynamics and properties across different cryptoexchanges, as well as over time. Profitable opportunities for arbitrage trading of either cryptocurrency across different cryptoexchanges have declined significantly since 2018. An introduction of a financial derivative traded at a regulated exchange that allows to benefit from decline in the price of bitcoin is found to have a significant impact on the dynamics of trading of both bitcoin and ethereum in the respective decentralized spot markets.",

            "abstract": "Abstract We examine the stock price reaction to surprises in the simultaneous releases of two types of news: macro news (captured by unemployment announcements) and corporate news (captured through earnings releases). Using financial data for the U.S. markets from 1962 to 2012, we confirm that earnings surprises and unemployment surprises significantly affect individual stock returns. Also, in line with Boyd et al. (J Bank Financ 60(2):649\u00e2\u0080\u0093672, 2005), we confirm that both surprises are significant during economic booms and contractions. However, while unemployment surprises are significant on a stand-alone basis, they are systematic events whose impact is captured within systematic risk-adjusted return models such as the Fama-French 3-factor and market models. This suggests that, for individual stocks, earnings surprises dominate unemployment surprises when dealing with simultaneous news releases. The stock market reaction to firm earnings surprises is enhanced during recessions, which can mostly be explained by systemic market functions.",

            "abstract": "Abstract This study investigates the tail-risk and returns relationship in an emerging equity market\u00e2\u0080\u0094India. We observe both the beta and the tail risk anomalies at the univariate portfolio level. However, after controlling for the lottery effects (MAX and idiosyncratic volatility), the relationship between the systematic tail risk measures and the expected returns turns positive for some of the proxies of tail risk, while the relationship between beta and expected returns becomes flat. The lottery effect explains the tail risk anomaly reported in the literate. These results suggest that investors care for probabilities of extreme changes in stock prices but do not care much about moderate variations in stock returns. Emerging markets have a significant presence of individual investors, who consider investing in the stock market as an opportunity to gamble and earn lottery-like payoffs, which results in an overvaluation of lottery stocks. Since these stocks also have high systematic risk and a high probability of extreme negative returns, we observe that the expected returns are negatively correlated with beta and left tail risk measures before controlling for the lottery effects. These results are robust after controlling for other relevant variables such as the size of the firm, book-to-market ratio, momentum, retail ownership, and illiquidity.",

Indeed, futures contracts permit to fix the price of electricity in advance for the use in the scheduled period. Our paper is devoted specifically to the Italian electricity market.

La base de datos empleada considera el comportamiento de doce acciones representativas en la Bolsa Mexicana de Valores en el periodo 2006 al 2016, el c\u00c3\u00b3digo fuente utilizado se encuentra disponible en \u00e2\u0080\u009chttp://bit.ly/396h3J1\u00e2\u0080\u009d; los datos fueron obtenidos de una plataforma especializada sobre mercados financieros en Latinoam\u00c3\u00a9rica (Economatica, n.d). Los resultados num\u00c3\u00a9ricos obtenidos muestran que la fase de filtrado es capaz de identificar un conjunto compacto de variables relevantes con alta influencia en el precio futuro de cada acci\u00c3\u00b3n en particular. En la segunda fase, se emplearon los datos del 2016 como valores a predecir sobre el modelo multiobjetivo y, comparado con el modelo de regresi\u00c3\u00b3n lineal m\u00c3\u00baltiple, se observa una mejora considerable en la calidad de los datos pronosticados, haciendo que el modelo generado a partir de la segunda fase tenga una confiabilidad mayor al 95%. / In this paper, a new methodology is presented to analyze and predict the behavior of stocks in the Mexican Stock Market based on the synergistic concatenation of non-parametric statistical strategies and multi-objective optimization models. This methodology involves two phases. The first (filtering) leverages an automated process for the analysis, evaluation, and selection of the necessary and relevant information for the characterization of the behavior of each action. The second (the model adjustment phase) involves adapting and solving a multi-objective model for the prediction of prices of the selected stocks. The database used for this research includes the behavior of twelve significant stocks in the Mexican stock exchange during the 2006 to 2016 period, the source code used is available at \u00e2\u0080\u009chttp://bit.ly/396h3J1\u00e2\u0080\u009d; the data was obtained from a specialized financial markets platform for Latin America. The numerical results show that the filtering phase can identify a compact set of relevant variables with a significant influence on the future price of each stock. In the second phase, the data from 2016 is used to predict the multi-objective model, which compared with the multiple linear regression model, provides a considerable improvement in the quality of the predicted observed data. The model generated from the second phase has a reliability greater than 95%.",

            "abstract": "The paper aims to examine persistence of shocks in returns on CDS for 5Y Croatian bonds. Based on sample of daily data from January 6, 2004 up until December 13, 2019 the paper evaluated research hypothesis that assumed persistence of shocks in returns on 5Y Croatian bond. To evaluate the research hypothesis, the paper employed quantile autoregression approach and nonparametric time varying autoregreession approach. The empirical results rejected the research hypothesis assuming persistence of shocks in returns on CDS for 5Y Croatian bonds. Based on the results from this paper, returns on CDS from for 5Y Croatian bonds are in line with efficient market hypothesis for endogenous shocks of small magnitude and at the highest level of endogenous shocks. Furthermore, efficient market hypothesis holds during the calm periods, while during the periods with more dynamics in CDS prices the paper suggests profitable strategy for trader and investors. Eventually, the paper contributes to the ongoing discussion regarding efficient market hypothesis while revealing the case of returns on CDS for 5Y Croatian bonds. Furthermore, the paper suggests trading and investment strategies for investors.",
