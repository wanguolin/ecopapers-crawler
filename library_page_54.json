            "abstract": "We categorize the stocks in the Taiwan share market by size, value, and growth, then form the portfolio index for each group according to the Taiwan Stock Exchange\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s weighted index method. Li and Yu\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s (2012) measurement method for investors\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 under- and overreactions, as well as Fama and French\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s (1993) three-factor analysis, are utilized to examine under- and overreactions regarding shares that cannot be observed by investors. The empirical results indicate that aside from the existence of under- and overreactions in the Taiwan Stock Exchange\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s weighted index, the indices formed according to stock size, value, and growth also contribute to price reactions.

This indicates that share prices would still be affected by both limited attention to other important information and the investor\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s anchoring",

            "abstract": "The literature in the area of index changes finds evidence that index changes are information free events. However, Denis, McConnell, Ovtchinnikov and Yu (2003) find evidence contrary to this theory. This study extends the work of Denis, McConnell, Ovtchinnikov and Yu (2003) in an attempt to complete the assessment of the information hypothesis of index changes. Denis, McConnell, Ovtchinnikov and Yu (2003) address only index additions and do not examine index deletions in their study. Our contribution is in filling this void in the literature by examining forecasted and realized earnings of firms discretionary deleted from the S&P 500 index in the period October 1989 \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009c December 2007.

Three different empirical tests indicate that anchoring is the driver of the 52-week high strategy which is long in stocks with a price at or close to their one year high price and short in stocks with a price far from their 52-week high. With sorting and regression approaches, it is further shown that the 52-week high strategy itself largely dominates the momentum strategy and that the distance of a stock\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s price to its 52-week high price is a better predictor of future returns than the momentum criterion.",

We document that prior to October 1989 the excess returns of added or deleted firms follow a white noise process around the event, whereas after the start of pre-announcing the excess returns can be described as nonstationary. This indicates significant excess profits to be captured around the addition or deletion event after S&P started pre-announcing changes in October 1989 but not prior to that date.",

            "abstract": "Are stock market investors concerned with obtaining abnormal returns by acquiring certain information? This paper studied the effect of ex-dividend date for cash-dividend policy. We try to demonstrate the existence of abnormal returns by examining stock trading situations before and after the ex-dividend date. We find that abnormal returns exist for listed Taiwan firms before and after the ex-dividend date. If an investor buys the stock of a firm who adopts a cash-dividend payout at the closing price 11 days before the ex-dividend date, and sells them at the closing price 10 days after the ex-dividend date, the investor will obtain an average 2.13% abnormal return, regardless of the transaction cost. This paper further analyzes whether firms adopting cash-dividend payouts have different abnormal returns on stock price performance depending on different variables.

            "abstract": "Kamal, Lawrence, McCabe, and Prakash (2012) argue that information asymmetry exists in the financial markets and additions to S&P 500 Index convey new information about the added firms to the uninformed investors. They further argue that because of important changes and regulations in the financial markets, like, Regulation Fair Disclosure, Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and Decimalization of the exchanges, in or after the year 2000, information asymmetry has decreased. In support of their arguments, they find that for additions, the positive abnormal returns on announcement day have decreased, and added stocks\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 liquidity changes have become marginal in the post-2000 period. We extend their work and for a sample of deletions between October 1989 and December 2011, we find that the negative abnormal returns on the announcement day are not significantly different in the post-2000 period, but the negative returns are reversed earlier in the post-2000 period. Contrary to our expectation, liquidity changes after deletion are significant in the post-2000 period. However, when we divide our sample into optioned versus nonoptioned stocks and control for other factors that affect liquidity, we find that liquidity changes after deletion are insignificant in the post-2000 period.",

This paper studied the effect of exdividend date for cash-dividend policy in the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TWSE) from 2001 to 2012. We try to demonstrate the existence of abnormal returns by examining stock trading situations before and after the ex-dividend date. We discovered the cumulative abnormal returns ratio reached 2.07% during the 10 days before and after the ex-dividend date. This paper further analyzes whether firms adopting cash-dividend changes have different abnormal returns on stock price performance depending on different variables. We discovered the average abnormal return ratio of the group with a cash dividend increase was 1.96%. The average abnormal return ratio of the group with a cash dividend decrease was 0.48%. Moreover, we analyze whether different industries impact cumulative abnormal return ratios. Finally, we discuss whether the cumulative abnormal return ratios were different before and after financial crisis.",

            "abstract": "We examine the dynamic relationship between self-tender returns, volatility and order imbalances. Since market makers care more about volatilities than inventory risk, they tend to lower the bid-ask spread to mitigate volatility. This result is different from the previous argument whereby market makers tend to raise the bid-ask spread to control inventory risk. A time-varying GARCH model also confirms the results that an order imbalance does not affect volatility during self-tender market convergency. We develop an imbalance-based trading strategy which is to buy (sell) according to whether order imbalances are positive (negative). The empirical findings support self-tender market efficiency.",

As an innovation we introduce a multiple criteria decision system making simultaneous use of trend indicators and other confirming indicators. By combining trend indicators with confirming indicators it is possible to build a superior technical trading strategy that captures a more comprehensive aspect of predictability in past prices. This study also proposes a test for weak form efficiency based on a combining approach. Previous approaches typically make inferences based on the empirical results of testing only one class of technical rules. Applying the combining criteria decision system the evidence suggests that the strategies proposed here have predictive ability on a data sample based on three European stocks Index Markets. Our results rejects the null hypothesis that the returns earned from applying trading rules are equal to those achieved from a naive buy and hold strategy, even after deducting transaction costs. Evidence also suggests that oscillators capture some aspect of predictability in past prices that moving averages do not detect.",
