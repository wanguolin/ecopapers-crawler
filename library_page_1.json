            "title": "The Other Month Effect: Some Evidence from the Central and Eastern European Markets",
            "abstract": "January returns on stock markets can be used as a barometer for the subsequent 11-month holding period returns as documented by Cooper et al. (2006). We examine this apparent anomaly and analyze the effects of other holding periods of 1, 3, and 6 months in six Central and Eastern European transition economies from January 1991 through December 2013. Our results do not support the presence of the other January effect (OJE) in five of the six markets. Instead, the results reveal significant anomalies in non-January months and that such effects vary across markets. This latter evidence might reflect different characteristics in these economies, including diverse levels of market efficiency, local risk factors, and portfolio management among others. Furthermore, we construct a trading rule using the other month effect to illustrate the possibility of developing profitable investment strategies to earn abnormal returns.",

Until recently, trading strategies that exploit this phenomenon were consistently profitable in the United States and in most developed markets. Similarly, stocks with high earnings momentum outperform stocks with low earnings momentum. This article reviews the momentum literature and discusses some of the explanations for this phenomenon.",

These forenamed time horizons were 1, 2, 3, 6, 12, 24 and 36-month periods. The examination was performed through a modified version of the method of DeBondt and Thaler (1985) with overlapping periods. In conclusion of the analysis, results supporting Overreaction Hypothesis and effectiveness of the contrarian strategies were found in most of the portfolio formation and test periods. This may indicate that ISE is not weak form efficient.",

            "abstract": "In this paper we examine shares that have been added to or deleted from the TSE 300 Index to determine whether abnormal price movements have occurred. We apply the dummy variable approach to event study methodology and adjust the estimated standard errors for arbitrary heteroscedasticity and clustering of events. We also use a non-parametric method of inference. Like authors of U.S. studies, we find that the market reacts positively to inclusion and negatively to deletion, albeit not significantly in the latter case. The information content of inclusion does not account for the entire share price response, lending support to the hypothesis of increased purchases by index funds.",

The study finds that bonds heavily bought by retail investors in one month underperform in the next month relative to bonds heavily sold, and the opposite holds for institutional investors. The alpha of the high-low portfolio (formed based on decile sorting on the buy\u00e2\u0080\u0093sell trade imbalance) relative to the usual market factors is significant for retail investors, but insignificant for institutional investors. The overall results indicate that retail investors in the corporate bond market suffer from behavioral biases but institutional investors do not. However, when the spread between the purchase and sell prices is factored into the returns, no profitable trading strategies exist, consistent with limits to arbitrage.",

We document the non-linearity of the market reaction to macroeconomic news. First, we find that the introduction of non linear models leads to the finding of a significant number of macroeconomic figures that actually produce an effect over the yield curve. Second, we noticed at least four types of patterns in the term structure reaction of interest rates across maturities, including the humpshaped one that is generally considered. Third, we propose a first interpretation and classification of these different shapes. Fourth we find that the existence of outliers in interest rates leads to an underestimation of the reaction of interest rates to announcements, explaining the different results obtained between high-frequency and daily datasets.",

Every system has its own price-forming process. However, these systems are not completely isolated. It is possible to have a restricted measure of electricity traffic between the systems. This article describes a value-creating trade strategy on the basis of the prices of electricity in The Netherlands and Germany, making use of the restricted electricity traffic between the two countries, providing empirical evidence on exploitable pricing inefficiencies in the electricity markets and potential trading strategies based thereupon. This research has not been conducted before and will provide a better understanding of the interaction between separate electricity markets.",
