            "abstract": "This paper develops a simple new methodology to test for asset integration and applies it within and between American stock markets. Our technique is tightly based on a general intertemporal asset-pricing model, and relies on estimating and comparing expected risk-free rates across assets. Expected risk-free rates are allowed to vary freely over time, constrained only by the fact that they are equal across (risk-adjusted) assets. Assets are allowed to have general risk characteristics, and are constrained only by a factor model of covariances over short time periods. The technique is undemanding in terms of both data and estimation. We find that expected risk-free rates vary dramatically over time, unlike short interest rates. Further, the S&P 500 market seems to be well integrated, and the NASDAQ is generally (but not always) integrated. However, the NASDAQ is poorly integrated with the S&P 500.",

            "abstract": "We examine the time-frequency co-movements and return and volatility spillovers between the rare earths and six major renewable energy stocks. We employ the wavelet analysis and the spillover index methodology from January 1, 2018 to May 15, 2020. We report that the COVID-19-triggered significant increase in co-movements and spillovers in returns and volatility between the rare earths and renewable energy returns and volatility. The rare earths act as net recipient of both return and volatility spillovers, while the clean energy stocks are net transmitters of return and volatility spillovers before and during the COVID-19 crisis. The solar and wind stocks are net transmitters/receivers of spillovers before/during the pandemic. The remaining markets shift from net spillover receivers to transmitters or vice versa; evidencing the effects of the pandemic. Our results show that cross-market hedge strategies may have their efficiency impaired during the periods of crises implying a necessity of portfolio rebalancing.",

Firms use a variety of methods to impede short selling, including legal threats, investigations, lawsuits, and various technical actions intended to create a short squeeze. These actions create short sale constraints. Consistent with the hypothesis that short sale constraints allow stocks to be overpriced, firms taking anti-shorting actions have in the subsequent year very low abnormal returns of about -2 percent per month.",

            "abstract": "We examine market efficiency of the opening and closing money lines (wager on the winner of a game) for National Football League (NFL) games from 2007 through 2016. A simple analysis shows that inefficiencies exist in the opening and closing NFL money line market. Inefficiencies in the closing money lines suggests that the money line market fails to completely adjust and eliminate some of these inefficiencies. Further, the market adjustments suggest that bookmakers may take advantage of bettors\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 biases to earn profits in excess of their commission. The results here support the existence of a reverse favorite-longshot bias, where bettors tend to overbet the favorite and underbet the underdog. These inefficiencies, however, are unpredictable and vary by season. Finally, utilizing game-specific factors, it appears that the presence of precipitation creates opportunities to earn profits when betting on the favorite.",

The test methodology adjusts for thin trading, pre- and post-revision abnormal performance and sample selection criterion effects. The models used to characterize returns include factors such as illiquidity and large trade activity. The positive and transitory median changes in traded volumes become insignificant when market-adjusted volumes are examined. No permanent effects on trade and analyst price behavior are identified. Traditional market-adjusted abnormal return inferences are not robust. The announcement window abnormal returns are smaller for annual versus non-annual index additions. This suggests that a longer advance notice period more than compensates for a larger number of simultaneous index revisions. The findings support the price pressure and liquidity hypotheses. Temporary changes in liquidity costs temporarily move stock prices from their equilibrium values, and announcement window abnormal returns are essentially reversed in subsequent periods.",

For that purpose, the behavior of the implied volatilities from the U.S. and Finnish markets is investigated around the employment, producer price index (PPI) and consumer price index (CPI) reports. The results confirm the hypothesis that implied volatility increases prior to the macroeconomic news release and drops after the announcement in both markets. This implies that uncertainty associated with the U.S. macroeconomic news releases is reflected in foreign stock markets as well. Of the macroeconomic news releases, the employment report has the largest impact on uncertainty.",

The tests cover the period 1980 to 1998. For a sample of highly scrutinized and visible firms strong seasonality in excess returns is reported. However, the firms in our sample have unusually low excess returns in January and returns adjust upwards over the remainder of the year. The results hold even after we control for various risk differences among the stocks of our sample. Further, this article\u00e2\u0080\u0099s findings imply that the January effect is not as pervasive across risk classes and industry sectors as earlier studies using aggregate data have shown it to be. The disaggregated data of this study provide evidence in support of the gamesmanship hypothesis, but not the tax-loss selling hypothesis. Whenever a January effect is observed, the last quarter of the year tends to be weak for those companies in our sample that experienced a strong January. The opposite is true when a January effect is not evident, as the gamesmanship hypothesis would predict.",
