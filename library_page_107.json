            "abstract": "The modeling of the extremal dependence structure can be made through parametric models classified in two families: Logistic and Mixed, which contain the symmetric and asymmetric models. The bivariate models are very useful in practical applications on the extreme value theory, in particular in a financial area. Considering the strong influence of the North American market on other financial markets, we investigate how does the dependence structure among the Latin American markets change after filtering the influence of the North American market. To remove that influence, we carry on a polynomial regression with GARCH (1,1) errors, and fit the bivariate extreme value models to the pairs of monthly maxima and minima of the standardized regression residuals.",

In contrast to findings in the US, we find no evidence of abnormal returns around the announcement of changes in the IBOVESPA. We find short-term positive abnormal return to stocks added to the IBOVESPA and IBrX50. There is evidence of negative cumulative returns for stocks excluded from the indexes. We also find positive abnormal trade volume on the date before the stocks were added to the IBOVESPA index.",

In principle, such confrontations show the plausibility and effectiveness of the developed method.",

Ourmethod is simple to apply and it ensures that the statistical results are heteroscedasticity consistentand robust to very general forms of cross-sectional and temporal dependence. Furthermore, ourregression-based technique also remedies several well-known weaknesses of the traditional calendartime portfolio approach. By considering a new, unique dataset on more than 40,000 Europeanprivate investors, we illustrate empirically that erroneously ignoring cross-sectional dependenceinherent in microeconometric panel data can lead to severely biased statistical results. Moreoverwe use our method to validate some of the most popular hypotheses on the performance of privateinvestors.",

In this paper we revisit the issue of thecnical analysis validation which has been tackled in the literature without taking care for (i) the presence of heterogeneity and (ii) statistical dependence in the analyzed data - various agglutinated return time series from distinct financial securities. The main purpose here is to address the first cited problem by suggesting a validation methodology that also \"homogenizes\" the securities according to the finite dimensional probability distribution of their return series. The general steps go through the identification of the stochastic processes for the securities returns, the clustering of similar securities and, finally, the identification of presence, or absence, of informatinal content obtained from those price patterns. We illustrate the proposed methodology with a real data exercise including several securities of the global market. Our investigation shows that there is a statistically significant informational content in two out of three common patterns usually found through technical analysis, namely: triangle, rectangle and head and shoulders.",

The model uses latent factors which are functions of both lagged volatility and returns. The model has several advantages: it is parsimonious; it does not require imposing parameter restrictions; and, it results in a positive-definite covariance matrix. We apply the model to the covariance matrix of size-sorted stock returns and find that two factors are sufficient to capture most of the dynamics. We also introduce a new method to track an index using our model of the realized volatility covariance matrix.",

            "abstract": "This paper presents novel empirical evidence on key predictions of heterogeneous firm models by examining stock market reactions to the Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement of 1989 (CUSFTA). Using the uncertainty surrounding the agreement's ratification, I show that the pattern of abnormal returns of Canadian manufacturing \u00e2\u0080\u00a6firms was broadly consistent with the predictions of a class of models based on Melitz (2003). Increases in the likelihood of ratification led to stock market gains of exporting firms relative to non-exporters. Moreover, gains were higher in sectors with larger cuts in U.S. import tariffs. Decreases in the likelihood of ratification led to opposite stock market reactions. Results for the impact of Canadian tariff reductions are less conclusive but most specifications suggest that exporters also gained relative to non-exporters in response to such reductions. Translating stock market gains into implied profit changes, I find that CUSFTA increased expected per-period profits of exporters by around 6-7% relative to non-exporters.",

            "abstract": "Background: Due to strong empirical evidence from different markets, existence of value premium became a financial theory standpoint. Although previous studies found that value stocks beat growth stocks in bearish and bullish markets, during the GFC, value stocks underperformed growth stocks. Objectives: This paper aims to examine the performance of value and growth stock portfolios after the GFC. Subjects of our analysis are constituent companies of the DJIA index, out of which portfolios of large-cap value and growth stocks have been constructed and evaluated. Methods/Approach: We measure the performance of stock portfolios, which are created based on the na\u00c3\u00afve diversification rule and random weighting approach. Statistical testing includes Levene\u00e2\u0080\u0099s homogeneity test, the Mann-Whitney U test, T-test, and the One-Sample T-test. Results: Growth stock portfolios outperform value stock portfolios after the GFC. The dominance of growth stock portfolios compared to value stock portfolios is significant, and the value premium disappears. Conclusions: Financial theory and investment management implications show that growth stocks have overtaken the dominance over value stocks since 2009. Causes might be in (1) expansionary monetary policy characterized by very low long-term interest rates and (2) high performance of the tech industry to which most growth stocks belong.",

We find an increase in risk, using several metrics, of mandatory and voluntary pension funds as well as a set of funds that better characterize the common movement of funds\u00c2\u00b4 returns.
