            "abstract": "Nowadays there is a large debate on whether the financial information proves any relevance for the investors\u00c2\u00b4 prediction of the securities market values/stock prices. The paper focuses, besides reviewing some important literature concerning this issue, on an empirical analysis taking into consideration 44 companies listed on Bucharest Stock Exchange based on pool data linear regressions. It is true that the most recent research state that there is an important evidence of a deterioration of the relationship between accounting information and stock prices. Although, the main findings of this paper consist in that there are certain aspects which should be further examined for a more reliable conceptual approach. In addition, it concludes that - even in the case of an emergent capital market as Bucharest Stock Exchange - it can be found mixed evidences to support the importance of financial information in portfolio\u00e2\u0080\u0099 management decisions. In a sense or another, the paper state overall that the financial information matter for market determination of financial assets\u00e2\u0080\u0099 values.",

            "abstract": "This paper examines the weak-form efficient market hypothesis (EMH) in the case of the Ghana Stock Exchange (GSE) an emerging market. Daily returns from the Databank Stock Index (DSI) over a 5-year period 1999-2004 were used for the exercise. Random walk (RW) and GARCH(1,1) models are used as the basis for our analysis. The GSE DSI returns series exhibit volatility clustering, an indication of inefficiency on the GSE. The weak-form efficient market (random walk) hypothesis was rejected for the GSE, meaning that the market is inefficient. The inefficient market has important implications for investors, both domestic and international. Knowledge of profitable arbitrage opportunities due to market predictability serves to attract investors to diversify from more efficient markets to invest on the GSE bourse to increase their returns.",

We study a single-beta conditional model and we show that stock market risk premium is variable over the time and is important for capturing predictable variations of stock returns. We find also that the expected excess returns on small and medium capitalization stocks are more sensitive to changes in the predetermined variables such as dividend yields, default spread and term spread, than expected excess returns on large capitalization stocks.",

We apply Stein's (1989) method to investigate whether the degree of overreaction differs between value and growth stocks using the implied volatility from option prices. A finding of overreaction for either value stocks or growth stocks would lend support to overreaction as an explanation for the value effect. Empirical results here indicate a stronger degree of overreaction for growth stocks.",

In particular, we assume that each speculator follows his own technical and fundamental trading rule. Moreover, a speculator's choice between these two trading philosophies depends on his individual assessment of current market circumstances. Our agent-based model setup is able to explain a number of important stylized facts of foreign exchange markets, including bubbles and crashes, excess volatility, fat-tailed return distributions, serially uncorrelated returns and volatility clustering. A stability and bifurcation analysis of its deterministic skeleton provides us with useful insights that foster our understanding of exchange rate dynamics.",

Therefore, using the daily individual stock\u00e2\u0080\u0099s return of 311 listed firms during an estimation period of 250 trading days; this research applies an Event Study Methodology to define the immediate stock market response to Covid19\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arrival in Bangladesh. Mean Return Model, Market Return Model, and Market model are applied to determine the Average Abnormal Returns and Cumulative Average Abnormal Returns for short term event window. Both Parametric and non-parametric tests of the significance of returns around the several event windows suggest that, despite the perceived weak market efficiency, the local stock market shows unprecedented efficient market reaction to the announcement. The significant statistical difference of CAAR between industry segments in both pre and post-event windows signifies that the negative impact of the announcement was identical for all industry segments. Behavioral overreaction induced Panic selling and herding effect has also been observed among investors due to the announcement. Findings from the study will be useful for investors and financial analysts in accessing the unpredictable systematic risk in portfolio diversification while facilitating policymakers to construct contingency strategy.",

            "abstract": "This paper looks at the dynamic price relationship between spreads in the corporate bond market and credit default swaps (CDS). It picks up where Blanco et al (2005) leave off but is focused on European credit markets. The study is based on companies listed in the iTraxx CDS index and thus on new data on a more liquid CDS market. Unlike previous studies, which look at price formation in a time-invariant context, the contributions of both markets to price discovery are analysed in a timevariant context. We devote particular attention to the question of whether such information input is stable in times of crisis and find that, although the CDS market slightly dominates the price discovery process, its contribution fell visibly during the turbulence on the credit markets in early 2005 in favour of that of the bond market.",

            "abstract": "For the DAX index market, this paper analyses the development of return differences between exchange traded funds (ETFs) and the DAX index from the perspective of long-term investors. The newly introduced methodology provides the opportunity to continuously identify long-term costs of passively managed products independent from the information of annual financial statements. This enables to test for product-specific return differences and to identify relevant cost drivers such as index returns and market makers. Results reveal that on average, DAX ETFs costs considerably exceed total expense ratios. Product-specific return differences are significant, however, differences tend to converge over time. For all ETFs, deviations are significantly influenced by index returns. Product characteristics deliver valuable arguments to explain these findings. Also market makers significantly contribute to return differences.",
