            "abstract": "This paper examines the existence of the day-of-the-week effect in overnight and daytime period returns in a group of broad-index exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the major U.S. stock indexes (S&P 500 and NASDAQ 100 indices) over the period from 1996 to 2018. Previous empirical studies suggest that the positive overnight minus daytime mean return spread could be of economic significance. However, empirical evidence is not entirely consistent across studies. To examine this effect, we use various inference procedures: the mean-variance (MV), Sharpe ratio (SR), and stochastic dominance (SD) approaches. The MV and SR results suggest a decrease or even the disappearance of the positive overnight minus daytime mean return spread. The SD results show that overnight periods do not dominate and are not stochastically dominated by daytime period returns, in the sense of first-order SD. These SD findings suggest that no arbitrage opportunities exist in U.S. equity markets and investors could not increase their wealth and expected utilities by switching from any daytime to overnight periods, or vice versa, over weekdays. Overall, the results suggest that information impounding mechanisms have become more efficient in U.S. markets.",

            "abstract": "In this study, we forecast the realized volatility of the S&P 500 index using the heterogeneous autoregressive model for realized volatility (HAR-RV) and its various extensions. Our models take into account the time-varying property of the models\u00e2\u0080\u0099 parameters and the volatility of realized volatility. A dynamic model averaging (DMA) approach is used to combine the forecasts of the individual models. Our empirical results suggest that DMA can generate more accurate forecasts than individual model in both statistical and economic senses. Models that use time-varying parameters have greater forecasting accuracy than models that use the constant coefficients. The superiority of time-varying parameter models is also found in volatility density forecasting.",

            "abstract": "We provide strong evidence that the dispersion of individual stock options trading volume across moneynesses (IDISP) contains valuable information about future stock returns. Stocks with high IDISP consistently underperform those with low IDISP by more than 1% per month. In line with the idea that IDISP reflects dispersion in investors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 beliefs, we find that the negative IDISP-return relationship is particularly pronounced around earnings announcements, in high sentiment periods and among stocks that exhibit relatively high short-selling impediments. Moreover, the IDISP effect is highly persistent and robustly distinct from the effects of a large array of previously documented cross-sectional return predictors.",

The distinction of the two concepts clarifies the relation between the market efficiency in the sense of Fama (1970) and the over- (under-) valuation for evaluating the stock market. Then, this study proposes an alternative measure of \u00e2\u0080\u0098magnitude of market inefficiency\u00e2\u0080\u0099 for accessing the trading systems and applies this measure to the nine stock markets during the two sub-periods. The trading systems of three markets improve in the second period, while the others become worse. This study also proposes an alternative measure of a fundamental value of stock price based on a macroeconomic model and makes clear the relation of the over- (under-) valuation of the market to the magnitudes of market inefficiency. Thus, the application to the Japanese stock market indicates that the magnitudes of inefficiency are small compared with the net over- (under-) valuations. It is because the magnitude of inefficiency is stationary while the net over- (under-) valuation is non-stationary.",

            "abstract": "This paper explores why the size effect vanished after the early 1980s. We show that the size effects are significantly positive primarily at the bottom of the business cycles. More importantly, this dependency of the size effect on the business cycles is preserved even after the 1980s. Therefore, our findings suggest that while unconditional size effect has perished, the size effect conditional on the business cycles is alive and well. The less frequent occurrences of troughs, due to prolonged business cycle length, are shown to be responsible for the dissolution of the size effect.",

We provide a comprehensive overview of commonly used quality definitions and test their predictive power for stock returns. We show that quality measures predict stock returns if and only if they forecast earnings growth, and that this information is not contained in other characteristics that have been shown to drive expected stock returns. At the same time, we find that the quality premium is unrelated to different measures of distress risk, and therefore inconsistent with a risk-based interpretation. Finally, our results are robust across different regions and carry over to the corporate bond market.",

Characteristics-based portfolios that minimize risk delivers superior out-of-sample performance. For instance, a minimum variance portfolio tilting toward small funds with high alpha and strategy distinctiveness index and low systematic risk delivers an annualized Sharpe ratio of 2.03 with a maximum drawdown of 5.20%. Investors realize diversification benefits by shifting a portion of their wealth from 60 to 40 equity-bond portfolio to characteristics-based hedge fund portfolio. Investors recognize the attractiveness of characteristics-based portfolios, but do not target flows enough to erode their superior performance.",

Leveraged exchange-traded products are useful for answering this question because they generate daily rebalancing flows whose size, sign and timing are predictable. This paper presents new evidence from the market for leveraged volatility products. While the daily rebalancing imposes an implicit cost on investors by putting pressure on closing prices, there is no evidence that the cost is driven by predatory trading. On the contrary, I show that larger and more predictable flows have smaller price impact coefficients, and that there are no excess profits from trading ahead of rebalancing flows during the sample period.",

We apply this new method to the S&P 500 and NASDAQ-100 ETF and E-mini futures markets. It turns out that conventional information shares for the ETF markets are overestimated. E-mini futures are traded almost continuously throughout the trading day and process additional pricing relevant information when the ETF markets are closed.",

This pattern is consistent across different methodologies for measuring forward-looking tail risk, using option contracts, and across various horizons.",
