            "abstract": "Abstract This study presents new evidence that industry-wide earnings surprises diffuse gradually across the supply chain at both industry and individual-firm levels. This evidence provides fundamental support for studies in the literature of gradual information diffusion, commonly using lagged returns as a proxy for information. To allow for the possibility that firms react differently to the industry-wide earnings surprises, this study measures how a stock\u00e2\u0080\u0099s returns respond to the part of its main customer or supplier industry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lagged returns that are associated with earnings surprises. A long/short equity strategy that combines the firm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s response coefficient and the prior month\u00e2\u0080\u0099s main customer/supplier industry return is shown to be profitable. The strategy tends to select medium-sized firms across industries. Firms in the winner portfolio are more likely to have a positive earning response coefficient and to be less capital intensive and financially constrained. Winners also experience positive responses to both positive and negative shocks while losers experience negative responses to both types of shocks.",

The study applied both non-parametric and parametric tests; Kolgomorov-Simirnov (K-S), runs, serial correlation and unit root tests on daily returns of KSE-100 index; KSE- all share index; KSE-30 index and KMI-30 index. The study finds absence of random walk on the former two indices, where chronology of firms and selection criteria are based on traditional market capitalization technique. However, evidence of random walk is found in stock-indices where selection of firms is based on free floating methodology. The trace of random walk advocates the free floating methodology over market capitalization criteria.",

            "abstract": "Abstract VIX exchange-traded products (ETPs) provide tracking on the return of a constant-maturity VIX futures index, instead of the uninvestable VIX spot index. In this paper, we develop a comprehensive framework to dissect the tracking performance of regular and leveraged VIX ETPs. In this framework, na\u00c3\u00afve investors in VIX ETPs expect to achieve the ETP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leverage ratio multiplied by the VIX return during their holding period, but the actual ETP return can deviate dramatically from this na\u00c3\u00afve expected return due to four components of return deviation. The index substitution deviation is shown to be the primary driver of the bull (inverse) VIX ETPs\u00e2\u0080\u0099 return erosion (enhancement), which can be explained by the negative roll-yield as a result of the contango term structure of underlying VIX futures index. For leveraged VIX ETPs over multiple holding days, the compounding deviation due to the \u00e2\u0080\u009cconstant-leverage trap\u00e2\u0080\u009d can be sizable. In addition, the NAV deviation due to expense ratio and fund management issues is negative, and the inefficiency deviation doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t accumulate over long holding periods due to the creation/redemption feature. Our return deviation framework can be generalized to other ETPs tracking indices that are either uninvestable or unrealistic to replicate.",

We follow Amihud\u00e2\u0080\u0099s (JFM 5:31\u00e2\u0080\u009356, 2002) structural approach; specifically, we estimate Amihud\u00e2\u0080\u0099s illiquidity factors, investigate the relationships between expected returns and illiquidity, and analyze the effects of expected and unexpected market illiquidity on future returns. We show that illiquidity plays an important role in expected returns for real estate stocks and investment trusts (REITs); however, it has less clear effects on open- and closed-end funds. We find that the adjusted ILLIQ includes appropriate correction factors for securities with low trading activity and is a useful improvement. We also find evidence of structural breaks in the relationship between returns and illiquidity.",

            "abstract": "Abstract This paper shows that equity-based aggregate insider trading predicts future changes in US corporate credit spreads. Results suggest that the closer insiders are involved in daily business activities, the greater the predictive power of those insiders\u00e2\u0080\u0099 transactions is. In line with the literature, we reason and find that closely involved insiders are better at gauging future changes in cash flow realizations eventually affecting a firm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s default risk, because these insiders have greater access to in-firm information. The predictive power of aggregate insider trading doubles each time we increase the forecast horizon and each time when gradually increasing the level of default risk from BBB to CCC spreads. For the standard BBB\u00e2\u0080\u0093AAA spread, a univariate model explains up to 52% in annual credit spread change variation and is economically meaningful. An increase in one standard deviation in aggregate insider trading translates into a decrease of up to 72% of the standard deviation of annual credit spread changes. The predictive power of aggregate insider trading is neither just driven by the 2007/08 financial crisis, nor only by information conveyed from net purchasing or net selling insiders. Our results recommend portfolio and risk managers to take aggregate inside information and the heterogeneity among insiders into account when assessing future aggregate default risk.",

We adopt the original frameworks of De Bondt and Thaler (J Finance 40(3):793\u00e2\u0080\u0093808, 1985) and Jegadeesh and Titman (J Finance 48(1):65\u00e2\u0080\u009391, 1993) to an intraday reversal as well as momentum strategy scheme based on 5-min stock returns. We analyze 16 reversal and momentum strategies each with ranking and holding periods of 60, 120, 180 or 300 min (reversal strategies) and 15, 30, 45 or 60 min (momentum strategies) from a retail investor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s perspective. We find no indications for momentum in stock prices but strong indications for reversals. Our results are furtherly robust regarding to market adjustment, portfolio sizes and skipping periods between ranking and holding periods. Our results show that the returns of the reversal strategies are statistically significant, however, yet too small to be economically significant. Our results also confirm the efficiency on the stock markets.",

It revisits the traditional approach to compute the long-run performance by conditioning aftermarket performance on idiosyncratic risk with a generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity GARCH-M extension of the standard three-factor Fama and French (3FF) model. Our findings show a positive long-run relationship between idiosyncratic risk and expected returns for almost all IPOs and matched non-IPO firms. We find that, in general, IPOs do not underperform their peers when we adjust long-run abnormal returns for firm-level idiosyncratic risk. We also note that the idiosyncratic risk exposure depends on the IPO profile; it is more important for firms going public in hot-issue markets, undervalued IPOs and high idiosyncratic-risk issues. Thus, this paper suggests that a part of abnormal returns in specific IPOs long-run performance is derived from firm idiosyncratic risk.",

Using U.S. data over the period 1926\u00e2\u0080\u00932015, we document persistent periods of low and high volatility spillovers between value and momentum strategies. Moreover, we find that the intensity of the volatility spillovers may change substantially in very short periods of time and that these shifts in spillover intensity can be linked to prominent economic events and financial market turmoil. Our results further demonstrate that value returns increase and momentum returns decrease monotonically with increasing volatility spillovers between the two strategies. Given this linkage between spillover intensity and returns, we propose a simple trading strategy which utilizes a volatility spillover index for allocating funds between value and momentum portfolios. The proposed trading strategy outperforms value and momentum strategies and generates payoffs that are not subject to option-like behavior.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Behavioral finance theory stipulates that the disposition effect plays an important role in inducing momentum. Using quantile regression analysis, this research is twofold. First is to examine the relation between the unrealized capital gains and expected returns. Second is to examine the capability of disposition effect as one of the underreaction models in inducing momentum in the most extreme quantiles (0.05th and 0.95th) of expected returns. To do so, we use a sample of 5176 firms, from January 1998 to June 2015. Following Grinblatt and Han (J Financ Econ 78:311\u00e2\u0080\u0093339, 2005), the findings show that the relation between unrealized capital gains and expected returns is significantly positive and decline as the quantiles of expected returns increase from the lowest to the median expected return quantiles. However, they become significantly negative and rise with the increase of expected returns quantiles above the median expected returns quantile. This indicates that disposition-prone investors exhibit disposition behavior below the median and median expected return quantiles, but they display the opposite behavior above the median quantiles of expected returns. Our findings also suggest that the disposition effect is not a good noisy proxy for inducing momentum at the lowest quantile of expected returns (0.05th). However, the disposition effect induces contrarian behavior at the highest quantile of expected returns (0.95th).",

Since Taiwan stock market requires listed companies to report their revenues every month, we further investigate how the arrival of revenue news affects these lottery-like stocks. It is found that when the high LHR is associated with positive shocks from the monthly revenue announcement, the stock becomes significantly less appealing to individual investors. As individual investors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 order imbalances drop substantially after the revenue announcement period, the modified MAX effect is diminished. We also find monthly revenues announcements greatly dilute the importance of quarterly earnings announcements and, therefore, play the more important role in determining the modified MAX effect. Overall, our study suggests that more frequent and promptly financial information disclosures, such as monthly revenue reports, are critical to improving market efficiency and reducing behavioral bias.",

By analyzing high-frequency data covering a twelve-year period, we discover that futures trading activity can be attributed to high-moment market risks, as observed in the significant explanatory power of realized high moments even after controlling for other risk factors. The results are robust to the use of various adjusted measures of high-moment risk, their subcomponents, various measures of trading activity, and data attributes.

Most importantly, this study finds that there exists a flow of market information from price risk to trading activity.",
