            "title": "Does seasonality persists in Indian stock markets?",
            "abstract": "The 'conventional wisdom' about efficient markets is that there are little excess returns, relative to the market returns (and the level of risk) that one can make by analysing historical data. But researchers have gathered systematic evidence about markets violating this conventional wisdom. Some of these are calender effects, small-firm or size effect etc. This paper examines a calender effect known as `the-month-of-the-year-effect' and examine whether this much-hyped anomaly is a persisting feature in the Indian market. The paper shows that the previous evidence on seasonality could be the result of the very nature of parametric methods, that it gets influenced by extreme observations. Otherwise, seasonality is not a feature of the current Indian stock markets.",

            "abstract": "We investigate the link between stock and options markets during the 2008 U.S. short sale ban. First, we find definitive evidence that the ban indeed caused stock overvaluation. Second, we show that the short sale ban caused a significant increase in put-call parity violations only in the direction of the short sale constraints and it significantly enhanced the stock return predictability of put-call parity violations. Third, the overvaluation is really large. A portfolio formed on the trading signal that the put-call parity violation is in the top quintile underperforms the lowest quintile portfolio by a statistically and economically significant abnormal daily return of 5.6% during the short sale ban period. We employ a novel and rigorous method of using TAQ intraday data to ensure that our high-low violation arbitrage portfolio as well as the five Fama-French factors used to estimate the abnormal returns are implementable by a hypothetical investor exempt from the shorting ban.",

            "abstract": "This paper delineates the simultaneous impact of non-anticipated information on mean and variance of the intraday return process by including appropriate variables accounting for the news flow into both the mean and the variance function. This allows us to differentiate between the consistent price reaction to surprising news and the traders' uncertainty about the precise price impact of this information. Focussing on the US employment report, we find that headline information is almost instantaneously incorporated into T-bond futures prices. Nevertheless, large surprises, and 'bad' news in particular, create considerable uncertainty. In contrast, if surprises in related headlines cross-validate each other, less room for differences of opinion is left, and hence volatility is decreased.",

            "abstract": "We show that macroeconomic growth at the end of the year (fourth-quarter or December) strongly predicts the returns of the aggregate market, small- and large-cap stocks, portfolios sorted on book-to-market and dividend yields, bond returns, and international stock returns, whereas economic growth during the rest of the year does not predict returns. End-of-the-year economic growth rates contain considerably more information about expected returns than standard variables used to predict returns, are robust to the choice of macro variables, and work in-sample, out-of-sample, and in subsamples. To explain these results, we show as the second main fi?nding of our paper that economic growth and growth in economic confidence (consumer con?dence and business con?dence) are strongly correlated during the fourth quarter, but not during the other quarters. In summary, we therefore show that when economic growth is low at the end of the year, confi?dence in the economy is also low such that investors require higher future returns. During the rest of the year, there are no such relations between growth, confi?dence, and returns.",

            "abstract": "An important claim of Bayesian learning and a standard assumption in price discovery models is that the strength of the price impact of unanticipated information depends on the precision of the news. In this paper, we test for this assumption by analyzing intra-day price responses of CBOT T-bond futures to U.S. employment announcements. By employing additional detail information besides the widely used headline figures, we extract release-specific precision measures which allow to test for the claim of Bayesian updating. We find that the price impact of more precise information is significantly stronger. The results remain stable even after controlling for an asymmetric price response to 'good' and 'bad' news.",

The results from the ARDL model suggest that herding exists at the JSE. The study also noted that herd behaviour takes place with lapses in time; however the unrestricted error correction results suggest that such behaviour has a high speed of adjustment, implying that herding is a short-lived phenomenon. Since the direction of the market affects investors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 behaviour, the study also investigated the asymmetric effects of herding behaviour during rising versus falling markets. While herding behaviour was identified during a rising market, the results did not support the presence of herd behaviour in a falling market.",

Recently, its futures basis has shown volatile behavior. This could reflect its inefficiency as a hedging tool and the inefficiency in AFET itself. This research examines the predictive power of some economic factors. The monthly data during June 2004 to October 2008 were used in the multiple regression analysis. The findings give evidence of statistically significant explanatory powers of the market and macroeconomic information in estimating the futures basis. The AFET could thus be categorized as semi-strong efficiency form of price. The efficiency could be increased by the effective dissemination of knowledge and information to investors to support their investment decision. In addition, the agricultural price risk should be managed through market-based tools.",

Using daily prices of the FTSE/JSE All Share index it is found that non-parametric methodology reveals distributional behaviour in the time series that is not captured by the random walk model. Based on the out-of-sample predicted mean square error, the F-test for two variances (those of both the observed series and the predicted one) and the bootstrap confidence interval and volatility, this method predicts the future behaviour of stock prices more accurately than the traditional random walk model has done.",
