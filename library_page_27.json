            "abstract": "We provide evidence on anchoring biases in insider trading using a stock\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 52-week high. When stock prices are close to their 52-week highs, insiders are reluctant to purchase stocks and willing to sell them. Similarly, when stock prices are far from the 52-week highs, they are willing to buy stocks instead of selling them. This anchoring behavior is robust to controlling for insiders\u00e2\u0080\u0099 contrarian strategy, firm characteristics, and trading ranges. We find that these biased insider trades are not able to predict future returns or may lead to losses to investors who follow such insider trading. Our findings suggest that insiders are prone to behavioral biases, notwithstanding their access to private information.",

Instead we find a positive log-linear relation between the number of constituent funds in a fund of hedge fund (n) and the respective assets under management, (AuM). More precisely it takes the form: n2\u00e2\u0088\u009dAuM. This relation is consistent with the predictions from a model of na\u00c3\u00afve diversification with frictional diversification costs such as due diligence costs. Finally, we demonstrate that individual FoFs diversifying more in line with our model\u00e2\u0080\u0099s predictions deliver superior performance and fail less likely .",

            "abstract": "This study shows that, to obtain a precise measure of the liquidity premium in the stock market, it is important to recognize the influence of information uncertainty on the pricing of liquidity. Information uncertainty, which is positively correlated with stock illiquidity but negatively priced in the stock market, obscures the estimation of the liquidity premium. After controlling for its influence, we find that the liquidity premium is statistically significant and economically important in the U.S. stock market. Moreover, the risk-adjusted liquidity premium remains significant in both the earlier and more recent sub-sample periods. Our study addresses the recent debate about whether liquidity is still priced in recent decades, given the significant improvement in the trading technology and increase of the trading volume during this period.",

            "abstract": "The idiosyncratic volatility (IVOL) anomaly, documented in Ang, et al. (2006), has garnered a great deal of attention in the literature. Yet questions remain regarding the robustness and pervasiveness of the IVOL anomaly, with a particular concern that the IVOL anomaly might simply be the manifestation of market microstructure effect. In this paper, we show that the IVOL anomaly is strong and pervasive after we exclude stocks most susceptible to market microstructure noise \u00e2\u0080\u0094 such as microcap stocks, penny stocks, and stocks with strong short-term return reversal. These results are robust to equal-weighting or value-weighting stocks in the IVOL portfolios. Our findings suggest that rather than being the cause of the anomaly, market microstructure noise actually weakens the IVOL anomaly.",

Exchange-Traded Funds\u00e2\u0080\u0099 (ETFs\u00e2\u0080\u0099) deviations are more significantly related to fund flows, which shows authorized participants taking advantage of arbitrage opportunities by creating/redeeming ETF units.

            "abstract": "Stock price synchronicity is a critical consideration for asset allocation, risk assessment, and hedging decision. We present novel evidence that individual stock returns comove more persistently on certain days of the week. Specifically, we show that release of macroeconomic news on Mondays, which typically see fewer announcements, leads to such stronger comovement, and that this is distinct from the Monday effect typically discussed in the literature. This synchronicity is more pronounced among large, old and low volatility firms, in both up- and down-market conditions. We argue this effect is partly due to \u00e2\u0080\u0098simultaneous contrast\u00e2\u0080\u0099, i.e., perception of stimulus depending on its surrounding environment. Monday announcements have a larger impact just as thunder in a quiet night sounds louder.

Factor momentum subsumes stock momentum, high-priced momentum, and industry momentum, digests its component factors and a variety of anomalies, and represents the momentum anomaly in China. Furthermore, mispricing correction helps explain factor momentum, which produces stronger returns during higher aggregate idiosyncratic volatility periods as well as among stocks with higher information asymmetry and short-sale constraints. Exposure to factor premiums and the manifestation of predictability determine factor momentum in China.",

Using a natural experiment in China, we show the exogenous relaxation of price limit improves price efficiency. Importantly, shortable stocks experience more improvement in price efficiency than non-shortable stocks. Event-study analysis further documents less delayed price discovery following the price-limit-hitting event on shortable stocks, which is explained by selling pressure from large institutional orders. Our findings suggest that alleviating shortsale constraints could synergize with the relaxation of trading restrictions to improve price efficiency.",

This study is motivated by what is presumably the most prominent media source of advice for retail investors in the United States, Jim Cramer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Mad Money broadcast. We analyze return metrics of stocks recommended by Jim Cramer. We differentiate among five different recommendations and across five different segments of the show to determine if pricing behavior differs in magnitude and persistence, depending on the nature of the recommendation and the segment of the show in which the recommendation appears. Results indicate that the pricing impact is greatest for stocks discussed on longer-duration segments of the show and that there is an asymmetric effect in terms of \u00e2\u0080\u009cbuy\u00e2\u0080\u009d versus \u00e2\u0080\u009csell\u00e2\u0080\u009d recommendations.

We find substantial overlaps in the association between returns and S&P 500- and crude oil higher moments. Net of these overlaps, PNG stocks share a significant negative relationship with crude volatility and positive relationships with crude skewness and kurtosis. Large cap stocks and those with a history of hedging exhibit negative loadings on crude volatility. However, after controlling for S&P 500- and crude oil returns and their risk-neutral moments, there is little evidence that PNG stocks systematically and significantly price either S&P 500- or crude oil volatility. We document a weak pricing of crude skewness, but find no evidence for the pricing of the implied higher moments of market returns.",

Implied volatility and higher moments are extracted from observed crude oil option prices using a model-free implied volatility framework and the Black\u00e2\u0080\u0093Scholes model. We find a tenuous and time-varying association between returns and implied volatility and its innovations. Specifically, changes in implied volatility are found to be meaningfully associated with crude returns only over the period spanning the recent financial crisis.
