            "abstract": "According to efficient market hypothesis, investors perceive all available information in the same manner and it is not possible that any investor obtain more profit than others. Various anomalies in stock markets cause the failure of the efficient market hypothesis. Anomalies mean that the returns of the stock market are different on each the time period. The existence of anomalies in stock markets is important for investors. In this study, it is examined to whether there are seasonal anomalies in Istanbul Stock Exchange. For this purpose, it is tested intra-day effect, day of the week effect, the January effect, intra-month effect, turn of the month effect, turn of the year effect and the holiday effect for the period of 2003-2012, using least squares method. According to results, there is an evidence for intra-day effect and day of the week effect in Istanbul Stock Exchange for this period.",

            "abstract": "The paper analyzes the sign and statistical significance of abnormal return generated on the New York Stock Exchange as a consequence of two US presidential elections cycles in November 2016 and November 2020. The analysis involved a total of 283 companies listed on the NYSE, in five business sector. The analysis relied on standard event study methodology. The main findings showed that companies in the military, financial and energy sectors have consistent reactions: positive when the Republican candidate wins the elections, and negative when the Democratic candidate wins. Electronic industry companies did not show consistent results: after the 2016 elections, there was no statistically significant abnormal return, while after the 2020 elections they recorded statistically significant positive abnormal return. As for companies in the medical sector, therewas no abnormal return after any election cycle.",

            "abstract": "We develop an asset pricing model with investor sentiment and extrapolative behavior by assuming that there are many investors in the market who form their stock demand by weighting the sentiment signal, the extrapolative signal and the value signal. Our model predicts that both investor sentiment and extrapolation impose positive effects on the stock price deviation from fundamental value, and the direction and magnitude of stock price deviation depend on the relative strength of the sentiment signal and the extrapolation signal. Futhermore, we find that the weights of the sentiment signal and the extrapolative signal are positively related to the short-term correlation of stock returns, while the lagged weight of sentiment signal negatively effects the short-term correlation of stock returns. Moreover, the model also predicts that the sentiment signal and extrapolative signal weights are positively correlated with stock volatility, and extrapolative behavior exacerbates the sentiment-driven stock volatility due to extrapolating endogenous stock returns. Finally, we find empirical evidence consistent with the model\u00e2\u0080\u0099s predictions.",

            "abstract": "This study aims to test the validity of base broadening hypothesis for the impact of changes in foreign investors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 ownership on the return, volatility and liquidity of the shares of the real estate investment trusts (REITs) traded in Borsa Istanbul between 2010 and 2018 by panel regression analysis. Results show that a statistically significant relation exists between the sudden changes in the ownership of the foreign investors and the return, liquidity and volatility of the shares for a short term (up to 3 months). So, it has been seen that base broadening hypothesis is not valid for a long period of time. Even if it can be claimed that price pressure hypothesis could prevail looking at the statistically significant relationship for a short time, it has been considered that this case emerged thanks to the domestic investors paying more court to the market with trading more shares when they were informed about the changes in foreign investors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 ownership depending on its nature as information content, not as a result of the traded shares actually by the foreign investors.",

Using data from the Taiwan futures market, the empirical results show that the dynamic relationship between the sentiment of foreign institutional investors and the futures returns is much stronger than that of the sentiment of domestic institutional investors and the futures returns. Our empirical results also display that the sentiment of foreign institutional investors Granger-causes the sentiment of domestic institutional investors, but not vice versa. Finally, the sentiment of foreign institutional investors has a larger effect on subsequent market returns and market states than that of the sentiment of domestic institutional investors. Overall, our empirical results suggest that the relationship among the institutional investor sentiment, market returns, as well as market conditions in the Taiwan futures market is dominated by the sentiment of foreign institutional investors.",

Despite being used for centuries in Japan and now having a wide following amongst market practitioners globally, there is little research documenting its profitability or otherwise. We find that these strategies are not generally profitable when applied to large U.S. stocks. Basing trading decisions solely on these techniques does not seem sensible but we cannot rule out the possibility that they compliment some other market timing techniques.",

The news sentiment ratio is calculated using content analysis under the semantic orientation approach, with our empirical results revealing that news reports released prior to the earnings announcements made by firms have significant negative impacts on the CARs of the stocks of such firms following their announcements. We also find that press freedom may reduce the explanatory power of news reports on positive abnormal returns. The greater (lesser) the level of press freedom in a particular market, then the weaker (stronger) the level of information asymmetry, which can lead to a reduction (increase) in the risk premium, ultimately resulting in lower (higher) CARs.",

            "abstract": "This paper investigates the empirical validity of the weak-form of the Efficient Market Hypothesis in the Mongolian equity market over Jan 1999 to Jul 2012. We examine the characteristics of the market by testing the fit of returns to a normal distribution using the Jarque-Bera Test, and find strong evidence against normality. The data also exhibits positive skewness and a high level of excess kurtosis. Next, we test for the presence of autocorrelation using the Ljung-Box Q Test and the non-parametric Runs Test, and find strong evidence against the null hypothesis of no autocorrelation for both of these tests. Finally, we test the associated Random Walk Hypothesis using the Augmented Dickey- Fuller Test and the Chow-Denning Multiple Variance Ratio (MVR) Test. We reject the null hypothesis of the presence of a unit root for the Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test. In addition, we find evidence against the Random Walk Hypothesis even after adjusting for the possible presence of heteroscedasticity in the MVR Test. Since all the tests present results consistent with weak-form inefficiency, we reject the weak-form of the Efficient Market Hypothesis for the Mongolian equity market.",

            "abstract": "Investors are told to be overreacting when their sentiment drives the price of a certain security up (down) enough to make it the biggest winners (loser), in most cases considering this overreaction period as long as 3 or 5 years. This paper studies the overreaction hypothesis in market indices. Using end of month data from December 1970 to December 2018 from 49 Morgan Stanley Capital International Indices we studied the overreaction hypothesis on Market Indices for 3- and 5-years\u00e2\u0080\u0099 investment periods. Instead of Cumulative Average Returns the returns were computed as Holding Period Returns to avoid the upward bias. We found strong return reversals for 3-year investment periods, which were statistically significant at a 5% significant level. However, the returns might be weaker depending on the time period we consider. When implemented only in developed markets there is still evidence which supports the overreaction hypothesis, although the excess returns are economically weaker. Evidence for the overreaction hypothesis was also found when 5-year investment periods were considered. Not only did losers outperform winners, but they were also less risky than winners. Regardless of the market, investment period and/or time-period considered, losers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 portfolio beta was always smaller than the winners\u00e2\u0080\u0099 portfolio beta. Notwithstanding these results, the overreaction strategy is sensitive to the time periods considered which highlights the possibility that the overreaction strategy success it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not time stationary.",
