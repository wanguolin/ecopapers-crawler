            "abstract": "Lucca and Moench (2015) document large average excess returns in U.S. equities before scheduled Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings from September 1994 to March 2011, leading to a puzzle not explained by standard asset pricing theory. We extend the sample to December 2019. We find that after first appearing before FOMC announcements accompanied by the Fed Chair press conferences, the pre-FOMC drift essentially disappeared after 2015 in both announcements accompanied by press conferences and announcements not accompanied by press conferences. We discuss a possible explanation for this change: reduced uncertainty.",

            "abstract": "This study examines the selectivity and timing performance of 218 UK investment trusts over the period July 1981 to June 2009. We estimate the Treynor and Mazuy (1966) and Henriksson and Merton (1981) models augmented with the size, value, and momentum factors, either under the OLS method adjusted with the Newey\u00e2\u0080\u0093West procedure or under the GARCH(1,1)-in-mean method following the specification of Glosten et al. (1993; hereafter GJR-GARCH-M). We find that the OLS method provides little evidence in favour of the selectivity and timing ability, consistent with previous studies. Interestingly, the GJR-GARCH-M method reverses this result, showing some relatively strong evidence on favourable selectivity ability, particularly for international funds, as well as favourable timing ability, particularly for domestic funds. We conclude that the GJR-GARCH-M method performs better in evaluating fund performance compared with the OLS method and the non-parametric approach, as it essentially accounts for the time-varying characteristics of factor loadings and hence obtains more reliable results, in particular, when the high frequency data, such as the daily returns, are used in the analysis. Our results are robust to various in-sample and out-of-sample tests and have valuable implications for practitioners in making their asset allocation decisions across different fund styles.",

            "abstract": "Energy companies, alternative or traditional, have been in the center of both financial and political debates during the last few years all around the world. Extensive crises related to fossil fuel resources have triggered the creation of brand new sources while the further development of already-in-use alternative sources is highly encouraged. Energy portfolios are important tools in most investor strategies and the way to incorporate new alternative energy companies in those portfolios has been a large part of the debate. Regardless of the strategy, be it in derivatives or traditional stock portfolios, risk anticipation and management are keys to a successful implementation. The purpose of this study, aside from filling a gap in literature, is to aid investors in risk anticipation and asset allocation through shedding some light on risk transmission effects between energy sub-sector company portfolios and energy commodities. Sub-sectors tested in this study include petroleum, coal, natural gas, solar, nuclear, wind, and biofuel companies. We find that risk spills over from energy companies to some commodities, and not vice versa. The most influential sub-sector is found to be petroleum companies.",

Specifically, by employing high frequency data across a wide range of fungible securities, we find that trading costs are a more important determinant of price discovery than either the implicit provision of leverage in securities such as futures and options or the existence of market segmentation. Moreover, securities with low trading costs display greater price discovery than those with high trading costs.",

We show that positive and negative shocks to security order flow reduce co-movement. Market order flow shocks have only a small impact on post shock correlations. Our results suggest that investors can increase diversification opportunities when forming dynamic portfolio strategies if they take account of security order flow information. We show that pre-shock firm characteristics allow investors to identify those stocks with the greatest diversification benefits.",

To do this, we used both the Quantile-on-Quantile (QQ) approach and the nonparametric causality-in-quantiles tests. Using the QQ method, the results show negative average and extreme dependence between EPU and FERs. Moreover, the structure of dependence between the considered variables is found to be asymmetric across the quantiles. By applying the nonparametric causality-in-quantile tests, we found a weak evidence of causality-in-mean (at middle quantiles) and a strong evidence of causality-in-variance (for almost all quantiles) from both local and U.S. financial and EPU to FERs. Finally, the linkages between EPU and FERs intensified during our analysis of the 2008\u00e2\u0080\u00932009 global financial crisis (GFC). These results have important implications for currency traders and monetary policy.",

            "abstract": "This paper shows that the degree of information asymmetry is lower for firms with more frequent news releases. The relation holds for various measures of information asymmetry such as the probability of information-based trading (PIN), permanent price impact, and adverse selection component of bid-ask spread, even after adjusting for endogeneity between news release and information asymmetry. By decomposing the PIN into intensities of uninformed and informed trades, similarly to Brown and Hillegeist (2007), we find that intensity of uninformed trading increases much more than that of informed trading for firms with more frequent news releases. As a result, information asymmetry, as is measured by PIN, decreases for such firms due to the large increase in the intensity of uninformed trading. Our findings highlight not only the importance of news releases in leveling the playing field of investors but also the role of uninformed investors in reducing trading cost due to information asymmetry.",

            "abstract": "This paper focuses on stocks that experience major price changes. Using analyst reports as a proxy, I find that price events accompanied by information are followed by drift, while no-information ones result in reversals. One interpretation of these results is that investors underreact to news about fundamentals and overreact to other shocks that move stock prices. Consistent with this hypothesis, information-based price changes are more strongly correlated with future earnings surprises than no-information ones. Furthermore, drift exists only when the direction of the price move and of the change in analyst recommendations have the same sign. Finally, the ratio of no-information to information-based price shocks is strongly correlated with aggregate implied volatility and also forecasts momentum returns.",

We show strong disagreements are prevalent among active, sophisticated investors. From 1997 to 2014, 30% of highly shorted stocks have high hedge fund ownership, but these stocks do not earn abnormal returns. Evidence shows that large simultaneous holdings of short sellers and hedge fund managers likely arise from their information-acquisition activities. Although active long or short positions on average predict subsequent stock returns, neither long investors nor short sellers consistently prevail when the two sides disagree.",

We consider a setting in which the presence of market-wide sentiment is combined with the argument that overpricing should be more prevalent than underpricing, due to short-sale impediments. Long-short strategies that exploit the anomalies exhibit profits consistent with this setting. First, each anomaly is stronger (its long-short strategy is more profitable) following high levels of sentiment. Second, the short leg of each strategy is more profitable following high sentiment. Finally, sentiment exhibits no relation to returns on the long legs of the strategies.",

We propose a Bayesian learning model where market participants receive fundamental information along with noisy estimates of news\u00e2\u0080\u0099 precision.

Increasing estimation errors induce stronger nonlinearities in price responses.
