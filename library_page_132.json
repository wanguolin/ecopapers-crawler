            "abstract": "The negative relation between asset growth (AG) and future stock returns is particularly featured by the overvaluation of high AG stocks. We propose that such overvaluation is attributed to investors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 lottery demand toward stocks with high maximum daily returns (MAX), resulting in higher AG premium among high MAX stocks. Our empirical results confirm this prediction. Further evidence indicates that the impact of lottery preference on the AG anomaly is robust to several alternative explanations, including overinvestment, limits-to-arbitrage, and the q-theory. Our study provides a new insight into the understanding of the AG anomaly.",

            "abstract": "While stablecoins such as Tether closely track the peg, there is some evidence for recurring spikes in stablecoins\u00e2\u0080\u0099 intraday volatilities rendering stablecoin volatilities unstable (Grobys et al., 2021). Using the Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard (2006a) methodology, the purpose of our study is to examine whether jumps in Tether have an impact on (subsequent) Bitcoin returns. We retrieve hourly data for Bitcoin and Tether from Bitfinex covering the November 2018 to June 2021 period and encode the binary choice (1 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 \u00e2\u0080\u0098jump\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and 0 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 \u00e2\u0080\u0098no jump\u00e2\u0080\u0099) using bi-power variation based on asymptotic distribution theory at 5% significance level for each trading day. Our results show that the joint effect of positive jumps in Tether in association with an 1% increase in Tether returns on the prior day significantly predict negative prices changes in Bitcoin ranging from -3.65% to -8.49% in daily terms. Our results remain robust even after controlling for various other variables.",

(2020). While conventional tests support EMH in the cryptocurrency market, the FNQKS unit root test does not support EMH. Considering non-linearity, Fourier breaks, and non-normal distribution in BTC and ETH exhibit asymmetric persistence. This allows investors to make adjustments to their portfolios in response to both negative and positive shocks.",

Our findings report that energy and the aerospace & defense sectors become the net receivers of return spillover effects from ESG investments after February 2022, suggesting that the Russian invasion of Ukraine led to a recalibration of investor priorities. Investor preference for energy and the aerospace & defense sectors has increased in the wake of their growing sustainability role.",

We construct a new measure of firm-level information uncertainty based on uncertainty premium implied by earnings announcement returns. This new measure fundamentally differs from other firm-level uncertainty measures. We find that high-uncertainty firms outperform low-uncertainty firms by 9.59 % per annum on a risk-adjusted basis. Furthermore, this return predictability persists for up to five quarters. Our uncertainty measure and its return predictability are primarily driven by the idiosyncratic component. Overall, our results support the existence of an uncertainty premium and cast doubt on the hedgeability of uncertainty.",

This study investigates an enhanced momentum strategy excluding stocks with extremely salient payoffs which attenuate the profitability of the momentum strategy.

We further find that the performance improvement is more prominent for loser portfolios than for winner portfolios.",

A time-varying information leadership share (ILS) measure assesses dynamic price discovery performance of the MSCI CCI and green bonds. We find that the MSCI CCI index dominates in the price discovery process in terms of time-varying ILS, despite the static result indicating the opposite. Further, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic had restrictively positive effects on price discovery as the crisis progressed.",

The RND provides exceptional detail about investors' expectations as intraday volatility increased to a level five times higher than it had been two years earlier. Arbitrage keeps the mean of the RND closely tied to the market index, but its autocorrelation is very different. We also find a strong pattern in the RND's response to stock index movements: The middle portion amplifies the index change by more than 50% in some cases. This overshooting increased during the crisis and, surprisingly, was stronger in up moves than down moves.",

By analyzing the introduction of satellite coverage for major retailers, this study finds that access to satellite data significantly enhances the return predictability of daily institutional trading. This improvement is more pronounced for stocks with severe information asymmetry and is driven by non-hedge funds. These results suggest that institutions, especially non-hedge funds, actively adjust their trading positions on a daily basis in response to satellite data.",

We develop a novel reversal strategy based on residual stock returns that does not exhibit these exposures and consequently earns risk-adjusted returns that are twice as large as those of a conventional reversal strategy. Residual reversal strategies generate statistically and economically significant profits net of trading costs, even when we restrict our sample to large-cap stocks over the post-1990 period. Our results are inconsistent with the notion that reversal effects are the result of trading frictions or non-synchronous trading of stocks and pose a serious challenge to rational asset pricing models.",

We examine betting exchange data on U.K. horse races to establish whether limited cognition is partially responsible for this clustering. The key tool in this study is the stark increase in cognitive load faced by traders during races compared to prior to races. Using an approach that is part regression discontinuity and part difference-in-differences, we find that traders exhibit a substantially higher propensity to quote round numbers, rather than the nearest non-round numbers, during races. This result is robust to a series of placebo tests.",
