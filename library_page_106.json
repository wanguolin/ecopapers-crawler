As result the dynamics of the data generation process, the returns can be described as function of two regimes (\"bull markets\" and \"bear markets\"). These cycles, however, they could be decomposed in other cycles, initial and final phases of the growth cycle (\"bull\") and decrease (\"bear\"). This decomposition was shown more coherent with the concept of speculative bubble, in which there is a nonlinear relationship between the price and their foundations.",

In this article, we review various measures of investor sentiment based on market, survey, and text and media data. There is ample evidence that sentiment can explain returns on stocks that are difficult to value and costly to arbitrage, such as unprofitable stocks, non-dividend-paying stocks, extreme growth stocks, and distressed stocks. However, much remains to be done. We discuss three issues for future research: aggregating measures over various sources and various time horizons, linking investor sentiment to technical analysis, and statistically modeling the evolution of investor sentiment.",

Several structural approaches based on the notion of economic uncertainty are discussed for generating these stylized facts about the variance risk premium, which has broad implications for various empirical asset pricing puzzles.",

            "abstract": "This study compares the mo-mentum profitability of Islamic and con-ventional stocks in Malaysia and examines whether the presence of momentum profits is market-state dependent. Winner portfolios are shown to outperform loser portfolios, sug-gesting that a momentum effect exists in the equity market. Islamic stocks exhibit stronger momentum than conventional stocks. Inter-estingly, although pursuing profit is not the primary goal of Islamic stock investors, the findings indicate that momentum profits for all Islamic stock trading strategies are higher than those for conventional stocks. The prof-its from momentum strategies for both stocks are market-state dependent. In all trading strategies, while there are significant positive momentum profits following market upturns, there is no evidence of profits subsequent to market downturns. Overall, Islamic stocks yield higher momentum profits than conven-tional stocks across market states. These find-ings are robust to using various measures of the state of the market. While the presence of momentum profits is also robust to the inclu-sion of Fama-French\u00e2\u0080\u0099s (1993) risk factors, the risk factors are unable to explain momentum profits, suggesting that the risk-adjusted mo-mentum profits are not due to risk compen-sation. Rather, the profitability is evidence of stock mispricing.",

            "abstract": "We use the Grossman & Stiglitz (1980) framework to build a reference portfolio for uninformed investors and employ this portfolio to assess the performance of actively managed equity mutual funds. We propose an empirical methodology to construct this reference portfolio using the information on prices and supply. We show that mutual funds provide, on average, an insignificant alpha of 23 basis points per year when considering this portfolio as a reference. With the stock market index as a proxy for the market portfolio, the average fund alpha is negative and highly significant, \u00e2\u0088\u0092128 basis points per year. The results are robust when considering various subsets of funds based on their characteristics and their degree of selectivity. In line with rational expectations equilibrium models considering asymmetrically informed investors and partially revealing equilibrium prices, our study supports that active management adds value for uniformed investors.

            "abstract": "The partially predictable character of stock returns is a sufficient condition to deduce that, at any time t, rational stockholders do not require a risk premium but a set of premia scaled by the horizon of the investment. Using expectations of the S ? P industrial stock price index in the NYSE revealed by J. Livingston? surveys, this paper provides an analyse of the dynamics of the ex-ante risk premia according to four horizon from six month to infinite. Although these premia exhibit very important and time-varying spreads, it is shown that the term premia with shorter horizon tend to converge progressively towards premia with longer horizons. These results show that there are common factors for all premia (past volatility and observed or expected economic variables) and that there is some coherence between the dynamics of premia. We conclude that experts effectively do not believe to the efficient market hypothesis. Classification JEL : D84, E44, G14",

            "abstract": "Capital Market Efficiency states that stock prices cannot be predicted based on the information set containing past price movements, publicly available information and even inside information. In addition to this, it is impossible to attain returns higher than the market return. On the other hand, in related literature on market efficiency, there is empirical evidence that state that there are some unexplained market movements called \u00e2\u0080\u009cstock market anomalies\u00e2\u0080\u009d. These anomalies that are studied in this paper those related to the \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Calendar Effects\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Calendar effects mean that, seasonality can be seen at different days of the week, different months of the year and some parts of months in stock prices. In this paper, seasonalities that are seen in financial markets throughout the world are researched for Istanbul Stock Exchange Market (ISEM). After investigating the related literature with regard to Efficient Market Hypothesis, existence of calendar effects in ISEM were researched with an empirical analysis during the period 04.01.1988 and 31.12.2007. The empirical results suggest that, \u00e2\u0080\u009cDay of the Week Effect\u00e2\u0080\u009d, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMonth of the Year Effect\u00e2\u0080\u009d, \u00e2\u0080\u009cTurn of the Year Effect\u00e2\u0080\u009d, \u00e2\u0080\u009cTurn of the Month Effect\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cIntra Month Effect\u00e2\u0080\u009d exists in ISEM.

It is also proven that expected volatility is being unbiased estimate of the actual return volatility (30-calendar days); hence, during the market turmoil VIX likely to be biased.

By utilizing event study analysis, our results suggest that grouping announcements have significant effect on stock prices and trading volume. The event day positive (negative) relationship between abnormal return and volume for the upgraded (downgraded) stocks supports the downward sloping demand curve hypothesis. Moreover, findings also suggest that stocks which are upgraded to Group A are exposed to more attention which is in line with the attention hypothesis. The reverse is valid for the downgraded firms. We find no evidence of price reversals and long-term symmetrical liquidity effect which lead us to reject price pressure and liquidity hypotheses. Finally, we reach controversial evidence for the information hypothesis",
