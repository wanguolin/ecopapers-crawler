            "abstract": "We assess the microstructure of the U.S. Treasury securities market following its migration to electronic trading. We model price discovery using a vector autoregression model of price and order flow. We show that both trades and limit orders affect price dynamics, suggesting that traders also choose limit orders to exploit their information. Moreover, while limit orders have a smaller price impact, their greater variation contributes more to the variance of price updates. Lastly, we find an increased price impact of trades and especially limit orders following announcements, suggesting that the private information derived from public information is disproportionally exploited through limit orders.",

We define an auspicious day as being on the Chinese lunar calendar, which is the common social norm in Chinese society. This norm is reflected in (i) more extensive and (ii) less profitable trading. Furthermore, this effect is heightened in cities with more elderly, more temples of the Wealth God, and more gambling sentiment. Individual investors' preferences for lottery-like and preferred stocks are essential mechanisms to explain our findings. We provide a first understanding of the effect of a social norm on individual investors' trading behavior.",

However, the quantile regression method reveals strong nonlinear causality: positive for high return quantiles and negative for low ones. Causality in quantiles is not a statistical artefact of causality in periods of high volatility, i.e., causality does not occur in a clustered manner. Causality in quantiles helps to explain the lack of causality between volume and raw returns on the one hand and a strong causal relationship between volume and return volatility on the other.",

High-frequency hourly data from September 12, 2021, to April 29, 2022, covering the period before and after the outbreak of conflict, is utilized for analysis. The empirical investigation employs the TVP-VAR and Quantile-VAR connectedness approaches. Our findings indicate a significant impact of the conflict on the Russian stock market, leading to increased market risk during the event period. Notably, certain sectors, including oil and gas, utilities, metals & mining, financials, consumer goods, and services exerted more influence on other sectors, while chemicals, transport, and telecoms were influenced by other sectors. These insights are crucial for comprehending the financial implications of the ongoing conflict on the local economy, providing valuable guidance to portfolio managers, investors, and policymakers in devising effective financial strategies.",

            "abstract": "In this paper we extend the model of Easley and O'Hara (1992) to allow the arrival rates of informed and uninformed trades to be time-varying and forecastable. We specify a generalized autoregressive bivariate process for the arrival rates of informed and uninformed trades and estimate the model on 16 actively traded stocks on the New York Stock Exchange over 15 years of transaction data. Our results show that uninformed trades are highly persistent. Uninformed order arrivals clump together, with high uninformed volume days likely to follow high uninformed volume days, and conversely. This behavior is consistent with the passive characterization of the uninformed found in the literature. But we do find an important difference in how the uninformed behave; they avoid trading when the informed are forecasted to be present. Informed trades also exhibit complex patterns, but these patterns are not consistent with the strategic behavior posited in the literature. The informed do not appear to hide in order flow, but instead they trade persistently. We also investigate the correlation between the arrival rates of trades and trade composition on market volatility, liquidity and depth. We find that although volatility increases with the forecasted arrival rates of total trades, it is relatively independent of the forecasted composition of the trade. We use the opening bid-ask spread as a measure of market liquidity. We find that as the number of trades increases over time, the relative proportion of informed trades decreases and hence, spreads become narrower and the market becomes more liquid. Finally, we compute the price impact curve of consecutive buy orders and report the half life of the price impact as a measure of market depth. We find a positive correlation between the half life and total trades indicating that the market is deeper in presence of more trades.",

We define sentiment risk as the sensitivity of stock returns to investor sentiment in financial markets. We incorporate a broad range of financial market variables in measuring financial conditions and use this as a proxy for market-wide investor sentiment. The paper distinguishes between rational and irrational (noisy) investor sentiment. Initial findings indicate a strong role for rational sentiment risk in the returns of FTSE All-Share stocks. However, further analysis reveals that this sentiment risk pricing is detected in the FTSE All-Share subgroup of FTSE small-cap stocks, while no evidence of sentiment risk pricing is found among the FTSE All-Share subgroups of FTSE 250 and FTSE 100 stocks. Our paper makes a key contribution by identifying that evidence of rational sentiment risk pricing disappears after controlling for the liquidity risk features of stocks. More generally, our findings point to a strong relation between sentiment risk and liquidity risk in stock returns and to the need for careful disentangling of sentiment versus liquidity effects.",

The Monthly returns of stock indices have been considered from 2010M02 to 2019M07. Two systems are considered. The first System, with Constant Conditional (C) mean, allows for market interaction. Results from DVECH model reveals that some sectorial stock markets are interdependent, the presence of a significance and positive effect of cross shock of Finance and Bank stock returns on Tunindex return, and volatility is predictable. C Correlation, \u00cf\u0081ij, have decreasing evolution for full period or for recent years for almost all i and j except CC between Tunindex return and R_FIN (and R_BANK) and CC between R_FIN and R_IND (and R_MATB). The tests for volatility spillovers effects suggests significant volatility spillovers from MATB and AUTO sectors to IND sector and from AUTO sector to MATB sector. The second system, with macroeconomic factor instability effects as Conditional mean, examine the CCC and DCC between different sectors. The main result supports the hypotheses of DCC. The DCC provides evidence of cross border relationship between sectors and macro economic instability factors have significant effect on the mean of returns evolutions (at 5% or 10% level). Volatility of exchange rate has significant positive effect on R, R_FIN, and R_MATB, while volatility of inflation has significant negative effect on R_Fin and volatility of oil price has significant negative effect on R_AUTO.",

However, investors enjoy greater benefit from directly investing in physical diamonds rather than diamond indices. For investors looking to protect their assets against highly volatile market conditions, precious metals remain a better option. Investors should continue to keep abreast of developments with the evolution of the diamond investments industry and physical diamonds can be included in a portfolio for their downside diversification potential.",
