            "abstract": "Many exchanges act to prevent manipulative orders from distorting informative price discovery during stock and options\u00e2\u0080\u0099 markets preopening. Most preopening sessions run in parallel: indicative book-based stock prices alongside traded index options, whose underlying asset is the indicative index. Lead-lag patterns between the options-implied and the indicative indexes may point to differences in informational efficiency and/or manipulated prices. With three regulatory events throughout our sample, serving as natural experiments, we explore price discovery properties in both markets. We find significant lead-lag, price reversal, and order cancellation patterns similar to those predicted by theoretical models of manipulation, together with informational inefficiencies.",

            "abstract": "This paper investigates the relationship between US stock market returns (S&P500) and three indicators of the market, namely implied volatility, implied correlation and liquidity. It also considers the short range dependence between both total confirmed cases and deaths in twelve countries and market movements. We use the two-regime Markov switching model to find the structural break between stock market returns and key stock market indicators. The findings show close dependence between returns and both implied volatility and implied correlation but not with liquidity. The findings indicate the unique role of Italy in crisis transmission.",

            "abstract": "The volatility of stock investor returns depends not only on the volatility of the stocks they hold but also on their time-varying capital exposure to these holdings. Using individual stocks, portfolios of stocks, and indexes across U.S. and international stock markets, we provide comprehensive evidence that the volatility of investor returns is consistently higher than the corresponding volatility of stock returns across nearly all specifications. The relative magnitude of the volatility differential ranges from 10% to 75%, increasing with investment horizon. This discrepancy is driven primarily by investors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 propensity to \"flee volatility,\" withdrawing equity capital following periods of high volatility.",

By measuring the style comovement to evaluate the influence of style investing on momentum, our evidence shows that the momentum profits on high style comovement portfolios are higher than on low style comovement portfolios. The momentum strategies on high style comovement portfolios are more profitable when the market is optimistic. Our findings demonstrate that style chasing behavior by investors is reinforced following increased market optimism, thus generating an asymmetric influence of style investing in momentum profits.",

To tackle this problem, we use the autoregression test of mean reversion based on the Gibbs-sampling-augmented randomization methodology. In general, our results indicated that Bitcoin is mean averting for different returns horizons, model specifications and for sub-sample periods, which show the explosive characteristic of the Bitcoin in the period of analysis from 2010 to 2019.",

In economic terms, a one standard deviation increase in sentiment \u00e2\u0080\u0093 measured by Google Trends \u00e2\u0080\u0093 explains about 2.5% to 5% of the unusual level of price clustering in Bitcoin.

            "abstract": "We perform an event study analysis to determine short-term abnormal stock returns following the Brexit referendum. Moreover, we examine whether firm-level internationalization helps explaining abnormal returns. We find that stocks of firms with higher proportions of domestic sales realized more negative abnormal returns than stocks of firms with more sales abroad, i.e., a higher degree of international diversification. While firm-level internationalization largely explains abnormal returns on the trading day after the referendum, it has no relevant pricing effect in the following days. The quick adjustment of stock prices to reflect firm-level internationalization indicates a high degree of market efficiency.",

We find strong existence of the Sell in May effect, robust to different regression assumptions, industries, and after controlling for the January or February effect. However, part of the puzzle is subsumed by the seasonal affective disorder effect. We then construct a trading strategy based on this puzzle, and find that it outperforms the buy-and-hold strategy and could resist the market downside risk during large recession periods.",

(1986) five factors as in Petkova (2006), are common factors in cross-sectional stock returns. We provide direct evidence that innovation in industrial production growth, a classical business-cycle variable that summarizes the state of the economy, is associated with the cross-sectional return predictability of individual stocks. We conclude that the role of innovation in aggregate risk is not random, and furthermore that it provides guidance concerning an important source of nonfinancial market-based risk in asset returns.",

We find a stylized fact that absolute price movements in stock and option markets are characterized by long memory and they present a fractionally cointegrated relation. The option prices appear to be valuable for the stock prices based on an appropriate econometric methodology, which captures the persistence of both price series. Our empirical results also support the presence of information effect in call option, but the volume effect is absent for all cases.",
