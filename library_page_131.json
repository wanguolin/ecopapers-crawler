            "abstract": "We explore the information sensitivity of corporate bonds throughout the COVID-19 crisis by examining whether there is a differential market response to firms with high operating leverage. Our results show that investors appear to discriminate based on firm operating leverage, which estimates the inability to adjust operating inputs quickly. Spreads of high operating leverage firms increase by 70 basis points upon the Fed\u00e2\u0080\u0099s corporate credit facilities announcement, while spreads from all other firms decreased, indicating concern about potential downgrades. When the facilities expanded, which made some downgraded firms eligible, spreads declined by 146 basis points for highly leveraged firms.",

            "abstract": "This study analyzes the relationship between COVID-19 related fear and short-term IPO performance. Though the average market-adjusted initial return of IPOs in the year 2020 is higher than that of the last four decades, it decreases if fear of pandemic increases. The evidence is robust when we use matching firm-adjusted initial returns. Next, we analyze the persistence of performance after the IPO date. The results show that the performance of IPO firms is more sensitive to the fear of the pandemic than the performance of similar existing firms.",

            "abstract": "We use state-level data to evaluate the connection between outbreaks of COVID-19 and stock returns over the period January-June 2020. We show that daily increases in the number of infected cases, hospitalized cases, and deaths are negatively associated with next day stock returns of firms headquartered in the same state. The relationship is weaker among states with high levels of medical resources and states that are likely to get support from the federal government. In addition, we find that the negative effect is reduced for firms that report an expectation that an outbreak will increase revenues and for firms with a strong corporate social responsibility practice. We believe our study is the first paper to assess cross-sectional stock price reactions to COVID-19 as a function of the state-level impact of the pandemic outbreak.",

The private information of order flow has a persistent impact on prices, and makes the short-term returns predictable. The predictability appears strong for the first five minutes, and perishes within thirty minutes. Furthermore, the information inherent in the order flow impacts the deeper levels of limit-order book, indicating the presence of informed traders beyond the best quotes. Overall, the results support the information asymmetry hypothesis for the pure order-driven market of India.",

Based on the empirical evidence in China, we show that VDTWI significantly and positively impacts stock market returns. Moreover, the out-of-sample forecasting of VDTWI also performs well. Results show that the model of VDTWI has an out-of-sample R-squared of 3.473% and great economic values, of which certainty equivalent return and Sharpe ratio gains are 8.683 and 0.630, respectively. Furthermore, combining the volatility of daily tug-of-war intensity and popular predictors can improve forecasting performance.",

We find that the stock market reacts positively to liquidity policy announcements by a more significant margin during and after the COVID-19 at market and industry levels compared with reactions to interest rate or monetary easing policy announcements. The economic consequences are large and persistent. Using firm characteristics as proxies for monetary policy transmission channels, we find that at firm level, the positive responses to liquidity policy announcements during the crisis are more pronounced for small and medium-sized businesses and non-state-owned enterprises relative to other enterprises.",

We propose that CEO overconfidence could enhance investors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 confidence in the stock's price even if the stock exhibits lottery-like payoffs. As a result, lottery stocks with overconfident CEOs are less prone to subsequent underperformance. Based on portfolio-based analyses and cross-sectional regressions, we provide robust evidence to confirm this hypothesis. Our study has important implications to the literature on both lottery-related anomaly and CEO overconfidence.",

Calculations show that the effective transfer entropy matrix is time-varying and stable over most periods, and that a few critical events strongly affect the information flow dynamics. We analyse the dynamics using IS (influence strength)-analysis and find that abnormal IS values were accompanied by high market volatility and major events. In particular, we find that the dominant information source changes drastically over time in the sequence of information flow networks, suggesting that the dominant sector is volatile.",

The results show that when investors engage in prospect theory, two-thirds of the anomalies are made correct predictions within a reasonable parameter range. We reveal that prospect theory\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to explain market anomalies is primarily driven by loss aversion and diminishing sensitivity in China. When factoring in prior gains and losses, retail investors do not demonstrate a predilection for gambling on \u00e2\u0080\u009clottery-type\u00e2\u0080\u009d stocks. We quantify prospect theory\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impact on Chinese stock pricing, proving psychological factors can be measured.",

Leveraging the unique disclosure requirement in Korea, which verifies rumors via firm disclosures, we are able to identify trading activities associated with rumors. We find that internet article coverage affects individual investors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 decisions, but not those of institutional investors. Moreover, the post-disclosure returns deteriorate only for individual investors with internet article coverage. Overall, these results suggest that internet articles adversely affect individual investors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 trading decisions on rumors, resulting in a wealth transfer from individual investors to institutional investors.",

We investigate data from January 2, 2018, to June 13, 2023 using BEKK- and DCC-GARCH. Crude oil volatility affects ASEAN+6 stock markets. Crude oil volatility spillovers were not statistically significant during pre-COVID-19, COVID-19 outbreak, and Russia-Ukraine war periods. After the crisis, asymmetric volatility remained prominent. The findings suggest that investors diversifying their portfolios should consider dynamic volatility and crude oil-stock price correlations to maximize returns and decrease risk.",
