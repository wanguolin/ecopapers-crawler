            "abstract": "This Paper analyses the empirical relationship between credit default swap, bond and stock markets during the period 2000-02. Focusing on the intertemporal comovement, we examine weekly and daily lead-lag relationships in a vector autoregressive model and the adjustment between markets caused by cointegration. First, we find that stock returns lead CDS and bond spread changes. Second, CDS spread changes Granger cause bond spread changes for a higher number of firms than vice versa. Third, the CDS market is significantly more sensitive to the stock market than the bond market and the magnitude of this sensitivity increases when credit quality becomes worse. Finally, the CDS market plays a more important role for price discovery than the corporate bond market.",

Utilizing the cross-sectional variations in the amount of individual stock that the BOJ has indirectly purchased in the program, the empirical analysis reveals that: (i) the BOJ\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ETF purchases instantaneously support stock prices on purchase, and (ii) the positive effects on stock prices, combined with the countercyclical nature of the BOJ\u00e2\u0080\u0099s purchases, affect the market beta and coskewness of Japanese stocks, leading to an economically significant decline in risk premia.",

            "abstract": "We use close to 80 million daily returns for more than 19,000 CRSP listed firms to establish the best forecasting model for realized idiosyncratic variances. Comparing forecasts from multiple models, we find that the popular martingale model performs worst. Using the root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) to judge model performance, ARMA(1,1) models perform the best for about 46% of the firms in out-of-sample tests. The ARMA(1,1) model delivers an average RMSE that is statistically significantly lower than all alternative models, and also performs well when not the very best. Its forecasts reverse large, unexpected shocks to realized variances. When using this model to revisit the relation between idiosyncratic risk and returns (the IVOL puzzle), we fail to find a significant relation. The IVOL puzzle is closely connected to a very small set of observations where the martingale forecast over-predicts the future realized variance. These extreme observations are correlated with well-known firm characteristics associated with the IVOL puzzle such as poor liquidity as measured by high bid-ask spreads and the \u00e2\u0080\u009cMAX\u00e2\u0080\u009d effect.",

            "abstract": "Using a large representative sample of Indian retail equity investors, many of them new to the stock market, we show that both years of investment experience and feedback from investment returns have significant effects on investor behavior, favored stock styles, and performance. We identify two channels of feedback: performance relative to the market, and the directly-experienced returns to behavior and styles of stock. Both of these vary across investors at a point in time because investors are imperfectly diversified and receive idiosyncratic returns. We find that experienced investors generally behave in a manner more consistent with the recommendations of finance theory, although this tendency is weakened by strong investment performance. High trading profits increase turnover, while high returns to equity styles have a short-term negative and a longer-term positive effect on investors' style demands, possibly reflecting the offsetting effects of disposition bias and style chasing.We document high returns on a portfolio of stocks held by experienced investors, and on individual Indian stocks with an experienced and low-turnover investor base.",

            "abstract": "The impact that informed and uninformed agents have on market prices is crucial for informational issues in financial markets. Informed trades are associated with institutional operators while uninformed trades are executed on behalf of retail investors. Using high-frequency data from Euronext Paris, I estimate a model where I take into account traders' identities at transaction level. The results show that when the identities of the traders are different on the two sides of the market, stock prices follow the direction indicated by institutional agents. This means that when the buyer is an informed operator and the seller is a retail one, the former transmits a positive pressure to the market. Conversely, when the seller is an institutional agent and the buyer is an uninformed one market prices depress. There is no significant effect when the agent types are the same on both market sides. Since traders' identities are concealed in Euronext Paris, the last part of the paper discusses the informational content implicitly provided by observed market variables. Institutional trading is found to increase throughout the day, whereas no evidence of informed trading is found during specific time periods of the continuous auction, except for the first thirty minutes of the day where there are more uninformed trades. Institutional trading is more common during periods of low price changes and high frequency of transactions. Price variations show that informed agents are usually able to trade at better price conditions. Finally, the tick-test algorithm strongly confirms that informed traders always act as initiators of market transactions.",

            "abstract": "In this paper, we measure how the fixed-interest market in Australia assesses and responds to new economic information. We use high-frequency data, precise announcement times and market-based forecasts to measure the reaction of bill and bond yields to news. The period covered is from January 1994 to September 1997. We find that announcements about US economic news have had a large impact on yields in Australia \u00e2\u0080\u0093 especially bond yields. Of the domestic announcements, the market responds to: monetary policy announcements, the CPI, the labour force and AWOTE, as well as a range of other economic statistics. We also find that the fixed-interest market seems to distinguish between the information contained in different economic announcements and that traders systematically respond to the size and direction of any unanticipated component of these announcements. The results suggest that the market perceives that information on prices, employment and wages is more important in the Reserve Bank\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decisions about monetary policy than are other indicators of economic activity. Taken in sum, the results also suggest some consistency of response to news in the fixed-interest market in Australia.",

            "abstract": "We present a model of quantitative trading as an automated system under human supervision. Contrary to previous literature we show that price-contingent trading is the profitable equilibrium strategy of large rational agents in efficient markets. The key ingredient is uncertainty about whether a large trader is informed about fundamentals. Even when uninformed, he still learns more from prices than market participants who still wonder about whether he is informed. Therefore, he will trade a non-zero quantity based on past prices, whose direction ? trend-following or contrarian ? depends on parameters. When informed, he will trade on that information and disregard the algorithm. One implication is that future order flow is predictable even if markets are semi-strong efficient by construction.",

We use daily closing prices of the top 20 fan tokens according to their market capitalization, along with Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Chiliz. The evidence from the GSADF test results indicates that the prices of 13 out of 20 fan tokens and the three cryptocurrencies have explosive periods associated with bubbles. Our results also show that the percentage of bubble days is between 0 % and 5% for all fan tokens. Among the 13 fan tokens exhibiting bubble behavior in their prices, nine have multiple sub-periods associated with bubbles, while only four tokens have a single sub-period with explosive prices. Bubbles in token prices are short-lived bubbles; most last for a few days. As a robustness analysis, we also perform LPPLS (Log-Periodic Power Law Singularity), providing similar results. Further analysis shows that trading volume, fan token return, Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU), Daily Infectious Disease Equity Market Volatility (EMVID) are positively associated with the presence of bubbles in fan token prices, while oil return is negatively associated with bubbles.",

            "abstract": "The current study evaluates the performance of the Fama and French three-factor model in a global setting with stocks selected from 15 European countries. We employed the multivariate regression approach after sorting six portfolios according to size and book-to-market. The constituent stocks were selected to represent each country of our sample. In order to homogenize the returns we used the spot exchange rates of non-euro-area countries to convert prices into euros. Since we were analyzing on a global portfolio level we used the MSCI EMU index as the proxy for the market portfolio. Daily returns were employed for a period of five years from January 2002 to December 2006. The results were not very encouraging for the three-factor model. Except for one portfolio, the three-factor model failed to explain the variations in returns, and even in the single portfolio that demonstrated size and value premiums, the market premium was insignificant. Our findings are consistent with Griffin (2002), who suggested that the three-factor model is domestic in nature and performs poorly for global portfolios.",

We construct a new four-fold beta decomposition, distinguishing cash flow and discount rate betas in up and down markets. Using CRSP data over 1963-2008, we find that the downside cash flow beta and downside discount rate beta carry the largest premia. We subject our result to an extensive number of robustness checks. Overall, downside cash flow risk is priced most consistently across different samples, periods, and return decomposition methods, and is the only component of \u00c3\u0098; that has significant out-of-sample predictive ability. The downside cash flow risk premium is mainly attributable to small stocks. The risk premium for large stocks appears much more driven by a compensation for symmetric, cash flow related risk. Finally, we multiply our premia estimates by average betas to compute the contribution of the different risk components to realized average returns. We find that up and down discount rate components dominate the contribution to average returns of downside cash flow risk.",
