            "abstract": "In this paper we examine how stock return synchronicity relates to changes in market-based measures of information-based trading in response to analyst recommendation revisions. We find that the market response to analyst recommendations varies according to R2: stocks with lower R2 experience stronger price, trading volume, return volatility, and bid-ask spread reactions in response to revisions of analyst recommendations. The impact of R2 is strongest among smaller companies, suggesting an elevated role for analysts in disseminating information when prices may be less informed. In a multivariate context, these results are robust to the inclusion of additional explanatory variables including firm size. Our results support the premise that R2 is inversely related to the noisiness of the information environment.",

Using the MF-DFA approach, we show evidence of long memory in both short and long term for all markets. Furthermore, the long memory is more pronounced in the long term than in the short term. Finally, Greece is the highest inefficient market, whatever is the time horizons, while Portugal and Ireland markets are the least inefficient in the short and long term, respectively. Global and regional stock markets are less efficient than GIPSI (except Greece) markets in the short term.",

            "abstract": "This study examines the quantile connectedness between eight green bonds and the S&P 500 index using the methodology of Ando et al. (2022). We show that green bonds and the S&P 500 index exhibit stronger connectedness during crises (GFC, COVID-19, etc.). Furthermore, green bonds are relatively less volatile during extraordinary events. The distribution tails dictate connectedness (short-term) in the wake of extreme events. The quantile spillover in the green financial markets largely originates from their energy and resource (water conservation) counterparts. These observations underscore the prevalence of upside, downside, and tail risks from green stock markets, particularly following crisis events.",

            "abstract": "Since 2012, all European Union countries have required disclosure of large short positions. This reduces short interest, bid-ask spreads, and the informativeness of prices. After specific disclosures, short-run abnormal returns are insignificantly negative, but 90-day cumulative abnormal returns are a statistically significant 5.23%. We find disclosures are likely to be followed by other disclosures, especially when the initial discloser is large or centrally located. However, there is no subsequent increase in short interest, and prices do not subsequently reverse. These results indicate that large short sellers are well informed, and that disclosures are not being used to coordinate manipulative attacks.Received June 30, 2014; accepted June 24, 2016 by Editor Itay Goldstein.",

            "abstract": "This paper investigates, theoretically and empirically, the dynamic of the implied volatility (ISD) around earnings announcements dates. The volatility implied in option prices can be interpreted as the market's expected level of volatility over the remaining life of the option. In this framework the paper proposes a theoretical model of the evolution of the ISD that takes into accound two well-known features of the instantaneous volatility: volatility clustering and the leverage effect. The model indicates that the ISD should decrease after an earnings announcement except after a bad news where it should be stable or even increase. An empirical investigation is conducted on the Swiss market over the period 1989-1998.The results confirm the main implications of the theoretical model.",

            "abstract": "We investigate whether or not a beta increases with bad news and decreases with good news, just as does volatility. Using daily returns for nine stocks in a double beta model with EGARCH specifications, we show that news asymmetrically affects the betas of individual stocks. We find that betas depend on two source of news: market shocks and idiosyncratic shocks. Some stock betas depend on both while others depend on one. We categorize each stock return as belonging to one of three beta process models, a joint, an idiosyncratic, and a market model based on the role of market shocks and idiosyncratic shocks. Our conclusions differ from those of Brown, Nelson, and Sunnier (1995) who worked with monthly aggregated data in a bivariate EGARCH model. We believe that stock price aggregation in this previous research resulted in a loss of cross sectional variation and consequently lead to weak results. If the asymmetric effect is more readily apparent in daily data, then this may again explain previous researchers' inability to detect asymmetric effects. Our findings shed light on the controversy as to whether abnormalities in stock returns result from overreaction to information or from changes in expected returns in an efficient market. Finding an asymmetric effect in betas leads us to conclude that abnormalities can, at least partially, be explained by changes in expected returns through a change in beta.",

The investors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 sentiment index is constructed from a pool of relative keyword series provided by the Baidu Index. We target two composite stock indices, namely the Hang Seng Index and the Shanghai Composite Index. We first compute the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient to find the degree of correlation between keywords and composite stock price indices. Then, we apply the FAVAR model to obtain the impulse response of stock price to the investors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 sentiment index. Finally, we examine the leading effects of keywords on stock prices using lagged correlation coefficients. We obtain two main findings. First, a strong correlation exists between investors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 sentiment and composite stock price: Second, before and after the launch of the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect, the keywords affecting the fluctuation of the Hang Seng Index are different.",

The analysed events which impact on stock rates of return were: setting a date of a video game premiere and postponement of a video game premiere. Moreover, the study tries to provide an answer to the question of whether the time of awaiting for a game premiere after its setting or postponement is related to stock prices. In order to collect and select the most numerous sample, an analysis of current reports of all fourteen video game companies listed on WSE Main Market and NewConnect Market in the period from January 4th, 2010 to July 31st, 2017 was carried out. The conducted study allowed for stating that the occurrence of the two event types mentioned does not have a statistically significant impact on stock rates of return. Only in the case of events classified as postponement of a video game premiere could a relation between the rate of return and the period of postponement be spotted. Such a relation is reflected as increased losses along with the postponement period extension.",

We apply dependence-switching copula approach, which allows for a state-varying dependence among markets under different market regimes (bear-bear, bear-bull, bull-bear, and bull-bull regime states). The results show that the U.S Islamic stock market serves as a hedge and a safe haven against oil price movements while its conventional counterparts acts only as a hedge. Morever, the tail dependence between the Islamic stock and oil markets is the lowest when a bullish Islamic stock market coexists with a bearish oil market. Furthermore, the dependence between the conventional stock and oil markets is smallest when a bear conventional market is associated with a bull oil market. Investor minimizes the systemic risk when he holds a short position in the oil market and a long position in the Islamic market, and who with long position in the oil market and a short position in the conventional stock market.",

Using Barun\u00c3\u00adk and K\u00c5\u0099ehl\u00c3\u00adk's (2018) methodology, we find evidence of time-varying volatility spillovers, which are intensified under major events. Moreover, the total volatility spillovers are higher in the short term than both the intermediate and long terms. A portfolio management analysis reveals that a mixed portfolio (commodity and stock markets) provides a higher level of hedging effectiveness for both emerging and developed markets. In addition, the hedging effectiveness in BRICS markets is more pronounced than in developed markets irrespective of frequencies. The hedging effectiveness is also higher using gold than oil and under the short term rather than both the intermediate and long terms. These results provide important implications for risk management and funds allocation.",

We explore whether disagreements among sentiment form a signal about the fundamental news of a company. We find that positive sentiment is associated with noise induced (uniformed) trading whereas negative sentiment contains value-relevant information about a firm's performance. Our empirical findings suggest that short selling activity reduces overreactions of abnormal returns in a noisy environment on the same day. Furthermore, we observe a sentiment convergence pattern around annual earnings announcements and low levels of sentiment homogeneity relate to significantly lower annual earnings surprise. This supports the view that disagreements among sentiments are a signal of bad news about firm fundamentals.",
