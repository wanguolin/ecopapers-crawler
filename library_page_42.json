            "abstract": "We study the dynamic impact of idiosyncratic volatility and bond liquidity on corporate bond spreads over time and empirically disentangle both effects. Using an extensive data set, we find that both idiosyncratic volatility and liquidity are critical mainly for the distress portfolios, i.e., low-rated and short-term bonds; for others only volatility matters. The effects of volatility and liquidity shocks on bond spreads were both exacerbated during the recent financial crisis. Liquidity shocks are quickly absorbed into bonds prices; however, volatility shocks are more persistent and have a long-term effect. Our results overall suggest significant differences between how volatility and liquidity dynamically impact bond spreads.",

We separate Chinese ADR daily returns into day and night returns to investigate the different market effects on ADR pricing. We compare \u00e2\u0080\u009chomeless\u00e2\u0080\u009d ADRs to home-based or cross-listed ADRs to see if they are affected differently by market factors. We find the night returns of Chinese ADRs are significantly affected by their home market (either the Hong Kong market or mainland China market) daily returns and the US market night returns. The US day returns appear to be the most significant pricing factor for the day returns of Chinese ADRs. The homeless ADRs are more affected by the US market and less affected by their home market compared to the cross-listed ADRs.",

            "abstract": "This paper reexamines the apparent success of two prominent stock trading strategies: long-term contrarian and intermediate-term momentum. The paper demonstrates that long-term contrarian is entirely attributable to the classic January size effect, rather than to investor overreaction, as argued by De Bondt and Thaler (1985). Further, the paper also resolves the Novy-Marx (2011) concern about whether return autocorrelation \u00e2\u0080\u009cis really momentum\u00e2\u0080\u009d by demonstrating that the superior performance of intermediate-term momentum is due to strong January seasonality in the cross-section of returns. The implications are that long-term contrarian must be considered largely illusory, and intermediate-term momentum must take account of annual seasonalities in returns.",

            "abstract": "The copula function defines the degree of dependence and the structure of dependence. This paper proposes an alternative framework to decompose the dependence using quantile regression. We demonstrate that the methodology provides a detailed picture of dependence including asymmetric and non-linear relationships. In addition, changes in the degree or structure of dependence can be modeled and tested for each quantile of the distribution. The empirical part applies the framework to three different sets of financial time-series and demonstrates substantial differences in dependence patterns among asset classes and through time. The analysis of 54 global equity markets shows that detailed information about the structure of dependence is crucial to adequately assess the benefits of diversification in normal times and crisis times.",

Results of the study indicate that (i) the Indian stock market reflects future real activity; (ii) the negative stock returns-inflation relation emerges fromthe unexpected component of the inflation and (iii) this negative relation vanishes when we control for the inflation-real activity relation, thereby providing a strong support for Famas proxy effect hypothesis.

Event study method is employed to analyze 25 renewable energy investment announcements during April 2015 and December 2023 period. Announcement date is defined as the event day and the 5 day period before and after the event day is selected as the event window. The length of the pre-event window in the timeline is chosen as 244 days. The total length of the period studied in the study is 250 days. The result of the study reveals that the renewable energy investment announcements of the energy companies listed in Borsa Istanbul seem to have no significant impact on the stock returns. Thus, Borsa Istanbul appears to be semi-strongly efficient.",

One characteristic of this type of crude is that it is sold at a discount rate that can oscillate between a 4- and 10-dollar discount from benchmark indices such as the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) Index and the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) Index. In the present study, we used event study methodology to determine the impact of global, regional, and local macroeconomic news, as well as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) announcements on the Castilla blend price. We found that even though OPEC announcements have a higher impact on prices, macroeconomic news that comes as a surprise from global and regional players had a significant impact on the Castilla blend price for the period under study from 2010 to 2019.",
