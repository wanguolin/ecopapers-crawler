            "abstract": "Earlier studies document the earnings announcement premium, that the average stock return around earnings announcements is positive. This study examines the earnings announcement premium with a focus on the relationship between stock returns and return volatilities. Our findings can be summarized as follows. First, based on the long-term data including the post financial crisis period, we find that the earnings announcement premium still exists, positive and significant. Second, the announcement premium is positively related to the expected volatility. The positive relationship between the announcement premium and the expected volatility indicates a risk-return tradeoff, suggesting that investors hold on to their stocks expecting that their taking risk is compensated with returns. Third, we find that the announcement premium is inversely related to the realized volatility. The negative relationship is not confined to the group of negative earnings surprises. These results suggest that a dynamic of inverse relationship between returns and volatilities coexists with a risk-return tradeoff around earnings announcements. Extending our study to Asian-Pacific stock market might shed lights on commonalities and differences in international risk-return tradeoff.",

            "abstract": "This study examines the switching volatility spillovers and connectedness between the Dow Jones Sukuk and global and two regional Islamic stock markets (World, Asia, and Europe). Using the Markov switching-vector autoregression and spillover index models, we show that Islamic stock markets are significantly affected by their own shocks under the low-volatility regime (Regime 1), whereas the results are insignificant under the high-volatility regime (Regime 2), except for the World Islamic markets. Similarly, Sukuk is affected by its own shocks, and the magnitude of the spillover increases in a high-volatility regime. Sukuk has an insignificant impact on Islamic stocks in Regime 1 and the effect becomes significant in Regime 2. Moreover, the likelihood of transition is more persistent in Regime 1 than in Regime 2. In addition, the shifts from one regime to another are more persistent than those in the opposite sense. Furthermore, the World Islamic stock markets are the net contributors of spillover to Sukuk for all regimes, and their capacity for spillover increases in Regime 2, whereas Sukuk is the net receiver of spillover for both regimes. In contrast, the ability of the European and Asian Islamic markets as net contributors decreases in Regime 2, and the contribution of Sukuk spillovers increases. Portfolio risk analysis under low- and high-volatility regimes is also discussed.",

            "abstract": "This paper analyzes the information effect of involuntary delisting and the possibility of informed trading in the Korean stock market. We find that the abnormal return is between 80% and 90% due to involuntary delisting in the Korean market, where liquidity all but disappears as a result of delisting. Prior to delisting, however, domestic individual investors are net buyers of delisted firms while both domestic institutional investors and foreign investors are net sellers. On the other hand, the share ownership of large shareholders, on average, declines by more than 30% over the course of two years prior to involuntary delisting. Using delisting probability model, we find that the change in the share ownership of large shareholders is a significant predictor of delisting while that of domestic institutional investors and foreign investors is not. Our findings suggest that large shareholders reduce their share ownership in anticipation of delisting and that there is a wealth transfer from individual investors to large shareholders surrounding involuntary delisting in markets where the separation between ownership and control is weak and the participation of retail investors is large.",

We use the quantile connectedness approach of Ando et al. (2022) to calculate hedge coverage ratios, optimal portfolio weights, and hedge coverage effectiveness. Our empirical analysis yields several important results. First, there is no difference in the results of the TVP-VAR-DY and TVP-VAR models in relation to the magnitude of return transmission during the sample period. Second, CU is the main transmitter and AU is the main receiver of shocks from the network. Third, under the QVAR method estimations, the CU (AU) is the major (minor) contributors to the network during the normal, bearish, and bullish market statuses. Fourth, the results of the hedge ratio strategy confirm that CU and AU are respectively the most and the least expensive assets for a long-term investment in the Chinese stock market in different market conditions.",

The results show that the dependencies within cryptocurrencies are highly symmetric and sensitive to different quantile arrangements. Under normal market conditions, we find a high positive dependence within cryptocurrencies and a low positive dependence between cryptocurrencies and gold. The dependence is higher at long term than intermediate- and short- terms before the pandemic during bearish market conditions. In contrast, the degree of dependence decreases at the intermediate- and long-terms during COVID-19 period than before. Moreover, the magnitude of return spillovers is higher at lower quantile (bearish market) than upper quantile (bullish market). Gold serves as a safe haven and diversifier asset for cryptocurrencies during COVID-19 outbreak at both intermediate and long terms.",

            "abstract": "Information regarding firms' data assets and stock pricing has been more closely related when data is integrated into firms' value creation processes. However, since data asset disclosure can also be engaged in impression management by firms, its contribution to market efficiency may be impeded. Using a sample of Chinese A-share listed firms from 2014 to 2020, this study examines the impact of increased data asset information disclosure on the subsequent stock price volatility. The findings suggest that more data asset disclosure reduces stock return idiosyncratic volatility. The mechanism analysis shows that data asset disclosure reduces idiosyncratic volatility of stock prices by mitigating analyst forecast dispersion and noise trading induced by buy-sell imbalances. Moreover, this mitigating effect is more pronounced in firms with more analyst following, observable digital investments, and higher liquidity. But the effect is diminished if firms use a more positive abnormal tone in their annual reports.",

However, there has been relatively little effort to predict the magnitude of the post-earnings announcement drift (PEAD). We show that the squared correlation coefficient (\u00cf\u00812) between order imbalance and earnings surprise determines the magnitude of market underreaction to earnings surprises and PEAD=k\u00e2\u008b \u00cf\u00812, where k is the information content of earnings. We discuss several testable implications of our analytical results, including a model-implied measure of information asymmetry that arises from the differential information processing ability of traders.",

Rivals also appear to experience improvements in their long-run financial and operating performances. Further, we find that the likelihood of rivals\u00e2\u0080\u0099 survival is greater subsequent to primary issues than secondary ones.

It also analyzes the potential conditional diversification benefits using a variety of copula functions and Conditional Value at Risk (CoVaR) measure. The results show significant crisis-sensitive and temporal dependence between oil and agricultural markets. Moreover, crude oil shows a symmetric tail dependence with both wheat, corn, soybeans, and cotton futures, whereas oil exhibits an average dependence with coffee. A strong dependence is observed between oil and cocoa (lumber) during bearish (bullish) market conditions. Oil and Live cattle have a symmetric dependence during bearish and bullish market conditions. On the other hand, we find asymmetric and bidirectional risk spillovers from oil to agricultural markets. Furthermore, the wheat futures contract appears to be the most dominating and vulnerable asset to oil price shocks, followed by lumber and corn futures, respectively, while the live cattle contracts are the least. Finally, an equally weighted portfolio offers the highest diversification benefits at a 5 % expected shortfall.",

I find evidence of the overreaction anomaly in the EGX within different price limit regimes. Price reversal is observed two and three days post lower and upper limit hits respectively within the strict price limits regime. However, it occurs after one day only for both lower and upper limit hits within the circuit breakers regime. These results support the directional effect hypothesis as large stock price movements are followed by price reversals in the opposite direction. Moreover, the results support the magnitude effect hypothesis as the larger the initial price movements the greater the subsequent reversals.",
