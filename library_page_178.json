            "title": "The Relationship between Volatility and Trading Volume in the Chinese Stock Market: A Volatility Decomposition Perspective",
            "abstract": "We use heterogeneous autoregressive (HAR) model with high-frequency data of Hu-Shen 300 index to investigate the volatility-volume relationship via the volatility decomposition approach. Although we find that the continuous component of daily volatility is positively correlated with trading volume, the jump component reveals a significant and robust negative relation with volume. This result suggests that the jump component contains some \"public information\" while the continuous components are more likely driven by \"private information\". Discussion of the intertemporal relationship supports the information-driven trading hypothesis. Lagged realized skewness only significantly affects the continuous component.",

            "abstract": "We test the hypothesis that individual investors contribute to the idiosyncratic volatility of stock returns because they act as noise traders. To this end, we consider a reform that makes short selling or buying on margin more expensive for retail investors relative to institutions, for a subset of French stocks. If retail investors are noise traders, theory implies that the volatility of stocks affected by the reform should decrease relative to other stocks. This prediction is borne out by the data. Moreover, around the reform, we observe a significant decrease in (i) the magnitude of returns reversals, and (ii) the Amihud ratio for the stocks affected by the reform relative to other stocks. We show that these findings are also consistent with models in which individual investors, acting as noise traders, are a source of volatility.",

This differs from standard finance theory, which provides no role for investor sentiment. We examine the relationship between investor sentiment and stock returns by employing textual analysis on social media posts. We find that our investor sentiment measure has a positive and significant effect on abnormal stock returns. These findings are consistent across a number of different models and specifications, providing further evidence against non-behavioral theories.",

            "abstract": "Abstract We compare the ownership characteristics of tobacco stocks with their peers in the same country and industry group. We find lower reported ownership for stocks in the tobacco industry, which suggests that anonymous investors are larger owners of these sin stocks. Compared to peer stocks, US and UK asset managers collectively overweight tobacco stocks, while norm-constrained investors such as sovereign wealth funds and pension funds underweight tobacco stocks. Passive managers have large stakes in tobacco stocks that are in line with the weights of these stocks in broad capitalization-weighted indices, indicating that passive replication of ethically screened indices is still a niche. We also identify some prominent active investors who take large positions in tobacco stocks.",

            "abstract": "Abstract The forward premium anomaly refers to the fact that changes in spot exchange rates are negatively related to interest rate differentials between home and foreign countries, which is contrary to the predictions of the uncovered interest rate parity (UIRP). We propose a regression model of the interest rate differentials across countries (known as carry trade) adjusted for a time-varying exchange rate risk premium which can explain the anomaly and provide forecasts of exchange rate changes in accordance to the theory. The proposed model is based on estimates of the exchange rate risk premium implied by a simple and empirically attractive two-country affine term structure model with global and local factors. We also show that the forecasting power of the model compares favorably to the random walk model of exchange rates, considered as benchmark in the literature.",

We measure bond liquidity using intraday transactions data and estimate the default component using the term structure of credit default swaps (CDS) spreads. With swap rate as the risk free rate, the estimated nondefault component is generally moderate but statistically significant for AA-, A-, and BBB-rated bonds and increasing in this order. With Treasury rate as the risk free rate, the estimated nondefault component is the largest in basis points for BBB-rated bonds but, as a fraction of yield spreads, it is the largest for AAA-rated bonds. Controlling for the unobservable firm heterogeneity, we find a positive and significant relationship between the nondefault component and illiquidity for investment-grade bonds but no significant relationship for speculative-grade bonds. We also find that the nondefault component comoves with indicators for macroeconomic conditions.",

            "abstract": "Abstract This paper investigates whether the investor attention effect caused by the Google stock search can be used to forecast stock returns. The evolving literature on Google search investor attention effect suggests that high Google search volumes can predict high returns for the first 1\u00e2\u0080\u00932 weeks, but with a subsequent price reversal. We use a more recent data set that covers the period from 2012 to 2017 in the Indian stock market and employ the quantile regression approach as it alleviates some of the statistical problems to find that high Google search volumes lead to positive returns. Indeed, the high Google search volumes predict positive and significant returns in the subsequent third, fourth and fifth weeks. The Google search volume index performs as a better predictor of the direction as well as the magnitude of the excess returns. The findings infer that the signals from the search volume data could be of benefit construction of profitable trading strategies.",

            "abstract": "Institutional portfolio managers face rating-based constraints established by investment policy statements (IPS) in their delegated management which, similar to formal regulations, restrict investment in bonds below certain rating levels. We analyze how prices and liquidity of corporate bonds traded by institutional investors react to downgrades crossing these internal limits. Consistent with the existence of a non-regulatory transmission channel, downgrades through regular IPS ratings have a greater impact on the market than downgrades crossing regulatory boundaries, such as the investment-speculative frontier and the NAIC's risk-based capital system thresholds. Our results reveal the existence of other source of rating-related frictions that should be considered.",

This gives us a rare opportunity to study an emerging retail-focused, highly speculative and unregulated market with trader identifiers at a tick transaction level. Jumps are frequent events and they cluster in time. The order flow imbalance and the preponderance of aggressive traders, as well as a widening of the bid-ask spread predict them. Jumps have short-term positive impact on market activity and illiquidity and induce a persistent change in the price.",
