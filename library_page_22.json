            "abstract": "This paper examines the impacts of COVID-19 on the multifractality of gold and oil prices based on upward and downward trends. We apply the Asymmetric Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (A-MF-DFA) approach to 15-min interval intraday data. The results show strong evidence of asymmetric multifractality that increases as the fractality scale increases. Moreover, multifractality is especially higher in the downside (upside) trend for Brent oil (gold), and this excess asymmetry has been more accentuated during the COVID-19 outbreak. Before the outbreak, the gold (oil) market was more inefficient during downward (upward) trends. During the COVID-19 outbreak period, we see that the results have changed. More precisely, we find that gold (oil) is more inefficient during upward (downward) trends. Gold and oil markets have been inefficient, particularly during the outbreak. The efficiency of gold and oil markets is sensitive to scales, market trends, and to the pandemic outbreak, highlighting the investor sentiment effect.",

            "abstract": "This study investigates the frequency connectedness among foreign exchange markets of G10 countries, focusing on tail risk and its implications for portfolio management. To do so, we use a novel framework that combines the Conditional Autoregressive Value-at-Risk (CAViaR) model with the novel time-varying frequency and quantile connectedness method developed by Chatziantoniou et al. (2022) based on Barun\u00c3\u00adk and K\u00c5\u0099ehl\u00c3\u00adk (2018) and Ando et al. (2018) approach. A key value of this paper to the literature is the provision of fresh empirical evidence on the extreme downside linkages among the markets examined. From the average connectedness measures, the top shock transmitters within the network were EUR, NOK, AUD, SEK, and NZD, while the main shock receivers emerged to be JPY and CHF, followed by CAD and GBP. We note that events in the major funding markets (the Eurozone, Japan) have a higher impact on the participants in these same markets than in relatively small markets (New Zealand, Norway). From the dynamic connectedness results, the magnitude of connectedness for the entire sample period increased during the COVID-19 era, compared to the magnitude before the COVID-19 outbreak. The cumulative spillover also reveals that USDNOK is the vastest net transmitter of spillovers to other markets, including SEK, CHF, and AUD. However, the EUR is the largest net beneficiary followed by JPY and CAD. Findings from the time-varying extreme downside analysis suggest that throughout the period, SEK and NOK are the other currencies' strongest and most frequent net spillover shock emitters for the short-, medium-, and long-term dynamics. Currency portfolio implications are discussed.",

            "abstract": "We examine the impact of COVID-19 pandemic crisis on the pricing efficiency and asymmetric multifractality of major asset classes (S&P500, US Treasury bond, US dollar index, Bitcoin, Brent oil, and gold) within a dynamic framework. Applying permutation entropy on intraday data that covers between April 30, 2019 and May 13, 2020, we show that efficiency of all sample asset classes is deteriorated with the outbreak, and in most cases this deterioration is significant. Results are found to be robust under different analysis schemes. Brent oil is the highest efficient market before and during crisis. The degree of efficiency is heterogeneous among all markets. The analysis by an asymmetric multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (A-MF-DFA) approach shows evidence of asymmetric multifractality in all markets which rise with the scales. The inefficiency is higher during downward trends before the pandemic crisis as well as during COVID-19 except for gold and Bitcoin. Moreover, the pandemic intensifies the inefficiency of all markets except Bitcoin. Findings reveal increased opportunities for price predictions and abnormal returns gains during the COVID-19 outbreak.",

            "abstract": "We examine the volatility spillovers and hedging characteristics between four major precious metals futures (gold, palladium, platinum, and silver) and seven major currencies (Australian dollar, British pound, Canadian dollar, Chinese yuan, Euro, Japanese yen, and Swiss franc) at three time horizons (short term, intermediate term, and long term). We draw our empirical results using the index methods of Diebold and Yilmaz (2012, 2014) and Barun\u00c3\u00adk and K\u00c5\u0099ehl\u00c3\u00adk (2018). The results show that the precious metals, except for gold, have the largest spillovers on the Australian dollar and Canadian dollar and receive the largest spillovers from these currencies for all the time horizons. In addition, with the exception of gold, the smallest spillovers from the precious metals are exerted on the Japanese yen and Chinese yuan and these currencies have the smallest spillovers to the precious metals. The Japanese yen and Chinese yuan act primarily as spillover receivers, whereas the other currencies act as both spillover transmitters and receivers in different time periods. The spillovers for most of the pairs are asymmetric for all the time horizons, are more pronounced in the short term, and noticeably increase during times of financial and economic uncertainty. Finally, adding precious metal futures contracts to currency portfolios provides diversification and hedging advantages, with hedging effectiveness higher in the short term than in the intermediate and long terms.",

            "abstract": "Efficiency and dynamic speculation literature focused on financial and crude oil markets whereas empirical studies on natural gas markets are limited. This study examines market efficiency and dynamic speculation in major European natural gas hubs (the Zeebrugge (ZEE) hub of Belgium, Title Transfer Facility (TTF) hub of the Netherlands, and National Balancing Point (NBP) hub of the UK) during the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia-Ukraine conflict. Using the Asymmetric multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (A-MFDFA) and the power law exponent (PLE) approach, we show that European natural gas markets exhibit an asymmetric multifractal behavior and long-memory effects, with variations observed during crises. The ZEE hub in Belgium and the NBP hub in the UK demonstrate a higher multifractality under different trends during the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine conflict, respectively. Notably, the TTF hub in the Netherlands emerges as the most efficient market during all subperiods. Moreover, our results, using the PLE approach, suggest that European gas market inefficiencies during crises can be attributed to speculative strategies that create self-perpetuating dynamics and diminish market transparency, leading to heightened risk and volatility in gas prices. Our findings underscore the need for regulatory intervention to mitigate excessive speculation and enhance transparency in gas markets. Diversifying gas supplies and fortifying European gas hubs emerge as pivotal strategies to bolster resilience and stability during crises.",

            "abstract": "This paper provides an extensive empirical investigation into the sources of index return autocorrelation, focusing on the relation between autocorrelation in individual stock returns and autocorrelation in index returns. The study uses daily data from the Stockholm Stock Exchange over the period 1980-1995 and reports three main empirical findings. Daily Swedish stock index returns exhibit strong, and consistently positive, first order autocorrelation throughout the sample period. Positive autocorrelation is observed for return frequencies between 1 day and 3 months. The most liquid stocks exhibit strong positive return autocorrelation. Less liquid stocks exhibit weak or negative return autocorrelation. Autocorrelation is asymmetric, high after days of above average performance of the stock market, low after days of below average performance. When compared to the other days of the week, both index returns and individual stock returns exhibit the strongest autocorrelation following on Friday returns. The transaction cost hypothesis was tested using the Swedish stock market transaction tax. Results indicate lower precision of stock prices during the transaction tax period, but no direct effect on return autocorrelation. The paper concludes that at least three sources contribute to observed return autocorrelation. For daily and short-term returns, profit taking and nonsynchronous trading are the probable causes of observed autocorrelation. For monthly and longer term returns, time-varying expected returns best describe the empirical results.",

            "abstract": "This paper introduces and analyses a model of cross-security information aggregation in a rational expectations equilibrium (REE). The model predicts a well-defined lead-lag structure between securities returns as a result of Bayesian information extraction from realised securities prices. Both leads and lags will be strongest between securities with highly correlated return processes, but only weakly correlated return innovations. Securities whose prices reveal highly precise signals will tend to lead other securities. The model has important implications for empirical testing of lead-lag effects between financial markets and instruments. As an application of the model, it is demonstrated that stock option returns will tend to lag the corresponding stock prices. Direct empirical tests of the lead-lag effects between individual stocks on the Paris Bourse provided strong support for the model. In addition to confirming the predicted pattern of leads and lags, the paper demonstrates that the cross-security correlation is higher for short-term returns than for long-term returns for about a third of securities pairs traded on the Paris Bourse. This result is interpreted as strong cross-security correlation of revealed information, which gives the model strong support over alternative specifications of multi-asset securities markets, such as the nonsynchronous trading hypothesis or the Chan (1993) model.",
