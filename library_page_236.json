            "abstract": "This study empirically assesses the relationship between inflation and stock return in Canadian stock market. The study has covered data for the period 1999 :M1\u00e2\u0088\u00922018 :M4 of canadian economy. Inflation has been decomposed to predicted and unpredicted phase by MA filter. First it has tested three hypothesis within static model : Fisher hypothesis, Fama and Schwert approach, and Fama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proxy effect framework. These investigations support Fisher Hypothesis. It has showed that Canadian stock market provides a complete hedge against Inflation. Second, since relationships between Stock price and inflation may not be correctly specified in the static linear regression, linear and non linear autoregressive dynamic specification have been tested. ARDL and NARDL model with Expected inflation as regressor conclude that Stock price cannot be used as a hedge against inflation. Finding of NARDL precise that only partial sum of the negative changes in Expected inflation have significant effect on canadian stock market. Then inefficiency of the canadian stock market suggests that information on past values of inflation could provide opportunities for abnormal gains from the canadian stock market.",

            "abstract": "How best to discern trading intentions from market data? We examine the accuracy of three methods for classifying trade data: bulk volume classification (BVC), tick rule and aggregated tick rule. We develop a Bayesian model of inferring information from trade executions and show the conditions under which tick rules or bulk volume classification predominates. Empirically, we find that tick rule approaches and BVC are relatively good classifiers of the aggressor side of trading, but bulk volume classifications are better linked to proxies of information-based trading. Thus, BVC would appear to be a useful tool for discerning trading intentions from market data.",

Specifically, when the availability of arbitrage capital is in short supply, momentum cycles last longer, and breaks in momentum cycles are shorter. We demonstrate the robustness of our findings with a unique database of stock returns from1866-1907 London and the CRSP database. Momentum cycle durations are similar in both databases and all other momentum facts documented in the literature using the CRSP database hold for the Victorian period as well, except for the January reversal due to the absence of capital gains taxation.",

            "abstract": "How much of carry trade excess returns can be explained by the presence of disaster risk? To answer this question, we propose a simple structural model that includes both Gaussian and disaster risk premia and can be estimated even in samples that do not contain disasters. The model points to a novel estimation procedure based on currency options with potentially different strikes. We implement this procedure on a large set of countries over the 1996-2008 period, forming portfolios of hedged and unhedged carry trade excess returns by sorting currencies based on their forward discounts. We find that disaster risk premia account for about 25% of expected carry trade excess returns in advanced countries.",

To decompose monetary policy surprises into these separate components we construct a measure of Federal Reserve private information that exploits differences in central bank and market forecasts. Contractionary policy shocks of either type lower stock prices with exogenous shocks having a larger negative effect. There is some suggestive evidence of an asymmetry; when FOMC meetings are unscheduled or when the fed funds rate reverses direction, stock prices rise in response to a contractionary Delphic shock.",

Considering the full sample with a significant variation among asset classes, the study reveals DeFi-DigiByte is the most efficient while the cryptocurrency-Tether is the least efficient. However, S&P 500 showed high efficiency before COVID-19, and DeFi-Enjin Coin advanced as the most efficient asset during COVID-19. The volatility dynamics of NFTs, DeFi, and cryptocurrencies follow strong nonlinear cross-correlations, but evidence of weaker nonlinearity exists in traditional assets. Additionally, the sensitivity to smaller events in bull markets is high for NFTs and DeFi. The findings have significant implications for portfolio diversification when an investor's portfolio set includes traditional assets and cryptocurrency and relatively new blockchain-based assets like NFTs and DeFi.",

            "abstract": "Abstract We study insider trading in a jump-binomial model of the financial market that is based on a marked binomial process and that serves as a suitable alternative to some classical trinomial models. Our investigations focus on the two main questions: measuring the advantage of the insider\u00e2\u0080\u0099s additional information and stating a closed form for her hedging strategy. Our approach is based on the results of enlargement of filtration in a discrete-time setting stated by Blanchet-Scalliet and Jeanblanc (in: From probability to finance, Springer, Berlin, 2020) and on a stochastic analysis for marked binomial processes developed in the companion paper (Halconruy in Electron J Probab 27:1\u00e2\u0080\u009339, 2022). Our work provides in a discrete-time and an incomplete market setting the analogues of some results of Amendinger et al. (Stoch Process Appl 89(1):101\u00e2\u0080\u0093116, 2000; Finance Stoch 7(1):29\u00e2\u0080\u009346, 2003), Imkeller et al. (1998, 2006) and extends in an insider framework some utility maximization results stated in Delbaen and Schachermayer (The mathematics of arbitrage, Springer, Berlin, 2006) and in Runggaldier et al. (in: Seminar on stochastic analysis, random fields and applications III, Springer, Berlin, 2002).",

The investigated risk measure applies a nonparametric approach that allows getting rid of any assumption on the distribution of returns, moreover, as presented in this paper, captures risk and expected return with superior performance. Furthermore, we also show that dollar-denominated returns often indicate a better fit than regressions in local currency suggesting that international capital inflow does play an important role in asset prices. This latter finding is particularly significant on Developed European capital markets, which is in contradiction with the belief of international investors having a greater influence on emerging markets compared to developed ones.",

We focus on behavior in secondary markets with or without ETF assets and whether there is zero or negative correlation in asset dividends. In the latter case, the diversification benefits of ETFs are most salient. We find that when the dividends are negatively correlated, ETFs reduce asset mispricing without decreasing market activity (turnover). When dividends are uncorrelated, the ETF has no impact on these same measures. Thus, our findings suggest that ETFs do not harm, and may in fact improve, price discovery and liquidity in asset markets.",
