            "abstract": "El estudio de la detecci\u00c3\u00b3n de comportamientos diferenciados en las cotizaciones de los activos subyacentes alrededor de la fecha de vencimiento de los contratos de derivados se justifica, en la literatura financiera, por la realizaci\u00c3\u00b3n de operaciones de arbitraje y/o especulaci\u00c3\u00b3n. El objetivo de este trabajo es ofrecer evidencia emp\u00c3\u00adrica adicional sobre el impacto del efecto vencimiento de productos financieros derivados en el mercado burs\u00c3\u00a1til espa\u00c3\u00b1ol como factor justificativo de estas operaciones. En particular, se pretende identificar si en el Nuevo Mercado se producen estas fluctuaciones y aportar evidencia sobre su cuant\u00c3\u00ada. Para ello, mediante la aplicaci\u00c3\u00b3n de la metodolog\u00c3\u00ada ARCH a datos diarios, se modeliza conjuntamente la media y la volatilidad del rendimiento de los activos subyacentes del segmento tecnol\u00c3\u00b3gico, incorporando la variable volumen de contrataci\u00c3\u00b3n como variable proxi de la llegada de nueva informaci\u00c3\u00b3n al mercado. Los resultados obtenidos apuntan a un efecto parcial sobre el mercado spot, desempe\u00c3\u00b1ando la liquidez un importante papel en su justificaci\u00c3\u00b3n. La estrecha relaci\u00c3\u00b3n existente, a priori, entre todos los segmentos del mercado burs\u00c3\u00a1til as\u00c3\u00ad como la pertenencia de las acciones del Nuevo Mercado sobre las que se negocian opciones al selectivo Ibex-35, nos llevaron a plantear un an\u00c3\u00a1lisis de la influencia derivada del vencimiento sobre derivados del Ibex-35 que podr\u00c3\u00ada ser justificado no por operaciones de arbitraje, pero s\u00c3\u00ad probablemente por operaciones especulativas.",

En particular, en los mercados financieros se ha constatado una evoluci\u00c3\u00b3n muy irregular, si bien la situaci\u00c3\u00b3n de Espa\u00c3\u00b1a respecto a otros mercados de acciones desarrollados, ocupa una posici\u00c3\u00b3n privilegiada, especialmente en el \u00c3\u00baltimo trienio. Este perfil favorable, que se inicia en el a\u00c3\u00b1o 1999, se ha traducido, en general, en un importante aumento de la liquidez del mercado que, incluso, podr\u00c3\u00ada ser calificada de mayor optimismo para el caso de las empresas gallegas.

            "abstract": "Although there is an extensive literature on the impact of volatility on asset returns correlation, investigating this in relation to broad asset selection and in perspective of different timelines has received less attention. In comparison to the previous papers, we use a much broader set of 35 selected asset classes and used rolling returns for five different periods ranging from 3 months to 5 years to calculate rolling correlations, which was used further for regression analysis between rolling correlation and volatility index (VIX). Results showed more impact of volatility on the mid-term horizon, such as 1 year, possibly meaning that for longer periods, structural economic factors impact correlation significantly, while for shorter periods, immediate market reactions to events and short-term fluctuations reduce the impact of the correlation. Autocorrelation of residuals suggests that correlation follows trends, which is evidenced more in longer periods. The study contributes to existing literature by comparing the volatility impact across a broad range of assets and multiple time horizons, revealing that correlation is sensitive to time horizons \u00e2\u0080\u0093 overall and in terms of responses to heightened volatility. Also, the impact of volatility is different over different time periods, with most impact for the mid-time horizon, such as 1 year.",

            "abstract": "The main purpose of this paper is to investigate the performance of initial public offerings (IPOs) in the emerging markets with particular focus on the markets of Balkan countries. The paper provides analysis of long and short performance of IPOs. In the Balkan emerging markets IPOs are relatively rarely used. Although all observed Balkan countries have gone through processes of transition from planned economies to market economies in the past 25 years, just a few state-owned companies have been privatized by use of IPOs. Due to this specific nature of the companies the analyzed sample of IPOs is comprised of state-owned and non-state-owned companies. The results are interpreted and expounded accordingly, taking into consideration the aforementioned conjunction. The findings indicate that company characteristics, signalling variables and financial variables have influence on the IPOs short and long term performance. The paper provides academia and policymakers with new revelations concerning the IPO processes in Balkan emerging economies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 capital markets.",

            "abstract": "The paper aims to determine the effect of split ratings on corporate bond yields. A Two-Sample t-Test was conducted for each risk category of bonds to assess the impact of split ratings. Using a sample of corporate bonds issued between January 2000 and May 2023, the study finds evidence that split-rated bonds exhibit higher yields. This suggests that investors demand greater compensation for the risk associated with split ratings, which stems from the informational opaqueness and uncertainty surrounding these instruments. The research also reveals that the magnitude of the difference between split ratings affects bond yields, with larger gaps leading to higher yields. The findings have significant implications for investors and issuers, emphasising the need to carefully evaluate split-rated bonds and consistent credit ratings. By enhancing our understanding of the relationship between split ratings and bond yields, this research promotes transparency and informed decision-making in the corporate bond market.",

            "abstract": "Research background Investment funds are an important part of the capital market. Household savings in this type of asset are increasing every year. From an investor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s point of view, the performance of funds is important. These, along with the risks, are what most often determine the choice of fund type and finally the specific fund. The performance of a fund is often determined by both the size of the fund and the application of the managers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 selectivity and market sense. Purpose The aim of this research is to investigate the impact of fund size on performance through the use of selectivity and market sense by managers. Dividing funds into size groups will allow the search for patterns in terms of managers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 use of market timing. Research methodology The research used a Treynor-Mazuy model as a market timing model and Ward\u00e2\u0080\u0099s method as the cluster analysis methods. The performance of the funds was determined using an investment performance indicator, i.e., Omega. Results The obtained results indicate that the funds are similar within the groups. However, there were differences in the results between the groups. During periods of high volatility, it is recommended to invest in units of funds with an average size below the median. Novelty The added value is the study of market timing in groups of funds similar in size. In each group, the results of the Treynor-Mazuy model estimation, and the Omega investment efficiency index were determined, and the differences in the obtained results between the groups were examined. Finally, all funds were clustered using the Ward method.",

            "abstract": "We show analytically under quite general conditions that implied rates of return based on analysts' earnings forecasts are only a downward biased estimator for future expected one-period returns and therefore not suited for computing market risk premia. The extent of this bias is substantial as verified by a bootstrap approach. We present an alternative estimation equation for future expected one-period returns based on current and past implied rates of return that is superior to simple estimators based on historical returns. The reason for this superiority is a lower variance of estimation results and not the circumvention of the discount rate effect typically stated as a major problem of estimators based on historical return realizations. The superiority of this new approach for portfolio selection purposes is verified numerically for our bootstrap environment and empirically for real capital market data.",

We analyze the consequences of using return estimates implied by analysts' dividend forecasts under the explicit notion of taxes and non-flat term structures of interest rates and achieve quite good performance results. As a by-product, these results cast some doubt upon the adequacy of estimating market risk premia with implied returns, because estimation techniques with good performance results are hardly suited to describe market expectations.",

            "abstract": "The estimation of expected security returns is one of the major tasks for the practical implementation of the Markowitz portfolio optimization. Against this background, in 1992 Black and Litterman developed an approach based on (theoretically established) expected equili-brium returns which accounts for subjective investors' views as well. In contrast to historical estimated returns, which lead to extreme asset weights within the Markowitz optimization, the Black-Litterman model generally results in balanced portfolio weights. However, the existence of investors' views is crucial for the Black-Litterman model and with absent views no active portfolio management is possible. Moreover, problems with the implementation of the model arise, as analysts' forecasts are typically not available in the way they are needed for the Black-Litterman-approach. In this context we present how analysts' dividend forecasts can be used to determine an a-priori-estimation of the expected returns and how they can be integrated into the Black-Litterman model. For this purpose, confidences of the investors' views are determined from the number of analysts' forecasts as well as from a Monte-Carlo simulation. After introducing our two methods of view generation, we examine the effects of the Black-Litterman approach on portfolio weights in an empirical study. Finally, the perfor-mance of the Black-Litterman model is compared to alternative portfolio allocation strategies in an out-of-sample study.",

            "abstract": "We develop a copula-based pairs trading framework and apply it to the S&P 100 index constituents from 1990 to 2014. We propose an integrated approach, using copulas for pairs selection and trading. Essentially, we fit t-copulas to all possible combinations of pairs in a 12 month formation period. Next, we run a 48 month in-sample pseudo-trading to assess the profitability of mispricing signals derived from the conditional marginal distribution functions of the t-copula. Finally, the most suitable pairs based on the pseudo-trading are determined, relying on profitability criteria and dependence measures. The top pairs are transferred to a 12 month trading period, and traded with individualized exit thresholds. In particular, we differentiate between pairs exhibiting mean-reversion and momentum effects and apply idiosyncratic take-profit and stop-loss rules. For the top 5 mean-reversion pairs, we find out-of-sample returns of 7.98 percent per year; the top 5 momentum pairs yield 7.22 percent per year. Return standard deviations are low, leading to annualized Sharpe ratios of 1.52 (top 5 mean-reversion) and 1.33 (top 5 momentum), respectively. Since we implement this strategy on a highly liquid stock universe, our findings pose a severe challenge to the semi-strong form of market efficiency and demonstrate a sophisticated yet profitable alternative to classical pairs trading.",
