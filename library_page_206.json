            "abstract": "This paper documents empirically that increases in the book-to-market spread predict larger market premiums in sample and larger size, value, and investment premiums (also) out of sample. In addition, increases in the investment (or profitability) spread exclusively predict larger investment (or profitability) premiums. This predictability generates \u00e2\u0080\u009cfactor timing\u00e2\u0080\u009d strategies that deliver substantial economic gains out of sample. I argue theoretically that the book-to-market spread is a price of risk proxy, while the investment and profitability spreads are factor risk proxies. The evidence confirms standard theoretical predictions in the macro-finance literature and contradicts the hypothesis of constant factor risks.",

            "abstract": "After the financial crisis in 2008, many central banks began to use unconventional monetary policy in order to boost the effective transmission of monetary policy and to provide additional direct monetary stimulus to the economy. This study will make use of an event study to analyse the impact of those unconventional monetary policies implemented by the European Central Bank on nominal and real long-term interest rates. The long-term interest rates being considered are the 10-year government bond yield, the 5 and 10-year corporate bond yield (AAA and BBB) and the 5y5y swap forward rate for the Eurozone. The results show that unconventional monetary policy conducted by the ECB had a significant effect on real and nominal and long-term interest rates. This effect can be more persistent for a specific group of countries during some announcements, namely the 4th of September of 2014 announcement significantly lowered the 10-year government bond yield and BBB 5-year bond yield for Portugal and the remaining PIIGS.",

We apply event study method to observe whether the large set of new information or surprise news is reflected immediately in bond yields. The daily yields of Government Bond with different maturity are regressed over the surprise factors. The bond yields are observed to react differently to the surprise factor of different indicators. Indian bond yield respond much more actively than bonds in China and Japan. Bonds of all the countries respond to the change in US government bonds, while Japan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s response is more than China , India\u00e2\u0080\u0099s response is the weakest.

We decompose market betas into four sub-betas (as- sociated with assets.and market.s cash .ows and discount rates) and we employ a discrete time version of the I-CAPM to derive a four-beta model. The model performs well in pricing average returns on single- and double-sorted portfolios ac- cording to size, book-to-market, dividend-price ratios and past risk, by producing high estimates for the explained cross-sectional variation in average returns and economically and statistically acceptable estimates for the coe\u00c2\u00a2 cient of relative risk aversion.",

            "abstract": "Abstract: We contrast the impact of traditional news media and social media coverage on stock market volatility and trading volume. We develop a theoretical model of asset pricing and information processing, which allows for both rational traders and a variety of commonly studied behavioral biases. The model yields several novel and testable predictions about the impact of news and social media on asset prices. We then test the model\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s theoretical predictions using a unique dataset which measures coverage of individual stocks in social and news media using a broad spectrum of print and online sources. Stocks with high social media coverage in one month experience high idiosyncratic volatility of returns and trading volume in the following month. Conversely, stocks with high news media coverage experience low volatility and low trading volume in the following month. These effects are statistically and economically significant and robust to controlling for stock and time fixed effects, as well as time-varying stock characteristics. The empirical evidence on news media is consistent with a market in which some traders are overconfident when interpreting new information. The evidence on social media is consistent with Tetlock (2011)\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093stale news\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac hypothesis (investors treat repeated information on social networks as though it were new) and with a model where investors\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 perceptions are subject to random sentiment shocks.",

We show that, by combining market fundamentals and timing opportunity with respect to market trend and volatility, the optimal strategy based on time series momentum of moving averages over short-time horizons and reversal significantly outperforms, both in-sample and out-of-sample, the S&P 500 and pure strategies based on either time series momentum or reversal only. The results are robust for different time horizons, short-sale constraints, market states, investor sentiment, and market volatility.",

            "abstract": "Evidence of stock return predictability by financial ratios is still controversial, as documented by inconsistent results for in-sample and out-of-sample regressions and by substantial parameter instability. This paper shows that these seemingly incompatible results can be reconciled if the assumption of a fixed steady-state mean of the economy is relaxed. We find strong empirical evidence in support of shifts in the steady-state and propose simple methods to adjust financial ratios for such shifts. The forecasting relationship of adjusted price ratios and future returns is statistically significant, stable over time, and present in out-of-sample tests. We also show that shifts in the steady-state are responsible for the parameter instability and poor out-of-sample performance of unadjusted price ratios that are found in the data. Our conclusions hold for a variety of financial ratios and are robust to changes in the econometric technique used to estimate shifts in the steady-state",

            "abstract": "We define a sentiment indicator based on option prices, valuation ratios and interest rates. The indicator can be interpreted as a lower bound on the expected growth in fundamentals that a rational investor would have to perceive in order to be happy to hold the market. The lower bound was unusually high in the late 1990s, reflecting dividend growth expectations that in our view were unreasonably optimistic. We show that our measure is a leading indicator of detrended volume and of analysts' long-term earnings growth expectations. Our approach depends on two key ingredients. First, we derive a new valuation-ratio decomposition that is related to the Campbell and Shiller (1988) loglinearization, but which resembles the Gordon growth model more closely and has certain other advantages. Second, we introduce a volatility index that provides a lower bound on the market's expected log return.",

            "abstract": "A key theoretical prediction in financial economics is that under risk neutrality and rational expectations, a currency's forward rates should form unbiased predictors of future spot rates. Yet scores of empirical studies report negative slope coefficients from regressions of spot rates on forward rates, which is inconsistent with the forward rate unbiasedness hypothesis. We collect 3,643 estimates from 91 research articles and using recently developed techniques investigate the effect of publication and misspecification biases on the reported results. Correcting for these biases yields slope coefficients of 0.31 and 0.98 for developed and emerging currencies respectively, which implies that empirical evidence is in line with the theoretical prediction for emerging economies and less puzzling than commonly thought for developed economies. Our results also suggest that the coefficients are systematically influenced by the choice of data, numeraire currencies, and estimation methods. The findings can be applied to calibrating carry trade strategies for individual currencies.",

We analyze more than 12 years of daily exchange rate data and show that continuous day-to-day changes in expectations of future US monetary policy has a significant and systematic impact on day-to-day changes in exchange rates. Our results imply that monetary policy matters for daily exchange rate determination in more ways than merely through infrequent, actual policy changes. Furthermore, when focusing on the actual monetary policy changes, the paper confirms that only the unexpected element of a policy change impacts exchange rates. The presented findings are generally consistent with the notion that exchange rates are forward-looking asset prices.",
