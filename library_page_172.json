            "abstract": "We develop a simulation-based procedure to test for stock return predictability with multiple regressors. The process governing the regressors is left completely free and the test procedure remains valid in small samples even in the presence of non-normalities and GARCH-type effects in the stock returns. The usefulness of the new procedure is demonstrated in a simulation study and by examining the ability of a group of financial variables to predict excess stock returns. We find some evidence of predictability during the period 1948\u00e2\u0080\u00932014, driven entirely by the term spread. This empirical evidence, however, is much weaker over subsamples.",

            "abstract": "We present a model of equity trading with informed and uninformed investors where informed investors act upon firm-specific private information and marketwide private information. The model is used to structurally identify the component of order flow that is due to marketwide private information. Trades driven by marketwide private information display very little or no correlation with the first principal component of order flow. This finding implies that a simple statistical factor is a poor measure of marketwide private information. Moreover, the model suggests that the previously documented comovement in order flow captures mostly common variation in liquidity trades. We find that marketwide private information obtained from equity market data forecasts industry stock returns and foreign exchange returns consistent with Evans and Lyons' (2004a) model of exchange rate determination.",

The diverse nature of the regressors caters for applications in a variety of settings. In addition, we extend the analysis to allow the stationary regressor to be instead locally stationary, and we allow the models to include a linear form of the integrated variable. Heteroscedasticity is allowed for in all models. We propose an estimation strategy based on orthogonal series expansion that takes account of the different type of stationarity/nonstationarity possessed by each covariate. We establish pointwise asymptotic distribution theory jointly for all estimators of unknown functions and also show the conventional optimal convergence rates jointly in the L2 sense. In spite of the entanglement of different kinds of regressors, we can separate out the distribution theory for each estimator. We provide Monte Carlo simulations that establish the favorable properties of our procedures in moderate sized samples. Finally, we apply our techniques to the study of a pairs trading strategy.",

Informed investors privately receive advance information that is useful for predicting future earnings, but is unrelated to current earnings. This information is immediately partially incorporated into stock prices. In response to good advance information, informed investors act as trend chasers and raise investments in both stocks and nontraded assets, leading them to bear more aggregate risk. This raises the expected risk premium and generates short-run momentum. Uninformed investors act as contrarians and sell stocks. When the advance information materializes in the future, excess returns fall, generating long-run reversals.",

We want to find out whether Brexit-related news, including the Brexit referendum itself, has an impact on the Pound sterling/Euro exchange rate. By splitting our Brexit-related events into 'good' Brexit news and 'bad' Brexit news, we find an impact of Brexit news on the British pound/Euro exchange rate. Bad Brexit news is associated with a depreciation of the British pound against the euro whereas 'good' Brexit news appreciates the Pound sterling against the euro. Furthermore, our empirical results suggest that market participants display a delayed reaction to bad and good Brexit news, respectively. Additionally, it seems that the impact of bad Brexit news on the spot exchange rate of the British pound against the euro is more persistent than the effect of good Brexit news.",

            "abstract": "Previous evidence has demonstrated that the momentum effect is present in the Spanish stockmarket, and that it can not be explained neither by the CAPM nor the Fama&French (1993) threefactor model. The aim of this paper is to deepen in the possible explanations of such phenomenon byanalyzing two new items. In the first part, the possibility that the momentum profits were therecompense for bearing some kind of risk not incorporated in this two models has been studied. Giventhe failure of this first approach, in the second part, the behavioural models of Daniel et al. (1998) andHong and Stein (1999) have been tested, by facing the momentum profits to the size, book-to-marketand analyst coverage characteristics. While the results show that the momentum profits focus on smallstocks, restrictions in the data hinder to obtain conclusive results regarding the validity of these twomodels in explaining the Spanish momentum. La evidencia previa en el mercado espa\u00c3\u00b1ol ha puesto de manifiesto la existencia de un efecto momentum robusto ante ajustes tanto por CAPM como por el modelo de tres factores de Fama y French (1993). Este trabajo trata de ahondar en las posibles explicaciones de dicho fen\u00c3\u00b3meno analizando dos nuevos aspectos. En una primera parte se estudia la posibilidad de que los beneficios del momentum sean consecuencia de la incorrecta especificaci\u00c3\u00b3n del modelo de valoraci\u00c3\u00b3n utilizado. Dada la dificultad de explicar los beneficios del momentum en base a esta alternativa, en una segunda parte se contrastan los modelos conductistas de Daniel et al.

However, such phenomenon has received scarce attention in the Spanish Market.In this paper, we present a meticulous analysis of the momentum profits in this market, with specialconcern on its possible sources. Consistent with the evidence obtained in other markets, themomentum strategy yields important profits that can not be explained neither by the cross-sectiondispersion of the expected returns nor by a positive autocorrelation in the return generating factor/s.Such phenomenon seems to be driven by a positive autocorrelation in the specific return component,which seriously questions the market efficiency hypothesis. Moreover, the momentum effectevidenced in the Spanish market shows some peculiarities that make it different from the existing onein other countries. Specifically, it seems to disappear in the nineties and does not show any seasonalityin January. El efecto momentum es quiz\u00c3\u00a1s uno de los enigmas m\u00c3\u00a1s desconcertantes a los que se enfrenta hoy en d\u00c3\u00ada la investigaci\u00c3\u00b3n relativa al mercado de capitales. Sin embargo, dicho fen\u00c3\u00b3meno ha acaparado escasa atenci\u00c3\u00b3n en el mercado espa\u00c3\u00b1ol.

For that, a nonlinear generating process of return will be considered and a STAR-APARCH model will be specified. This model allows a nonlinear behavior in the conditional mean and in the conditional variance. The empirical results show that the Ibex35 follows a nonlinear and asymmetric process, both in the conditional mean as in the conditional variance, so the weak-version of efficient market hypothesis is rejected. El trabajo analiza el comportamiento del Ibex35, durante el per\u00c3\u00adodo que abarca desde enero de 1999 a diciembre de 2011, con el objetivo de comprobar si sigue un proceso diferente al paseo aleatorio, de tal forma que su rendimiento no se caracteriza por ser ruido blanco y resulta, en contra de lo que implica la hip\u00c3\u00b3tesis de los mercados eficientes, predecible. Para ello se va a tener en cuenta la posibilidad de que el proceso generador del rendimiento sea no lineal y se va a especificar un modelo STAR-APARCH, que permite un comportamiento no lineal, tanto de la media como de la varianza condicional. Los resultados emp\u00c3\u00adricos evidencian que el comportamiento del Ibex35 sigue un proceso no lineal y asim\u00c3\u00a9trico, tanto en la media como en la varianza condicional, rechaz\u00c3\u00a1ndose el cumplimiento de la versi\u00c3\u00b3n d\u00c3\u00a9bil de la hip\u00c3\u00b3tesis de los mercados eficientes.",

We show that prices are farther away from (closer to) fundamentals compared with average expectations if and only if traders over- (under-) rely on public information with respect to optimal statistical weights. Both phenomena, in turn, occur whenever traders speculate on short-run price movements. For a given, positive level of residual payoff uncertainty, over-reliance on public information obtains if noise trade displays low persistence. This defines a \"Keynesian\" region; the complementary region is \"Hayekian\" in that prices are systematically closer to fundamentals than average expectations. The standard case of no residual uncertainty and noise trading following a random walk is on the frontier of the two regions and identifies the set of deep parameters for which traders abide by Keynes' dictum of concentrating on an asset \"long term prospects and those only.\" The analysis explains accommodation and trend chasing strategies as well as momentum and reversal.",

It is found that the insider manipulates the market using a contrarian strategy in order to neutralize the effect of the trades of competitive informed agents. Furthermore, consistent with the empirical evidence available, we find that information revelation accelerates close to the opening; that the market price does not converge to the fundamental value no matter how many rounds the t\u00c3\u00a2tonnement has; and that the expected trading volume displays a U-shaped pattern. We also find that a market with a larger competitive sector (smaller insider) has an improved informational efficiency and an increased trading volume.

Using order book data from the Australian Stock Exchange, we model traders' aggressiveness in market trading, limit order trading as well as in order cancellations on both sides of the market using a six-dimensional autoregressive intensity model. The information revealed by the open order book plays an important role in explaining the degree of order aggressiveness in the individual processes. Moreover, evidence for significant dynamic interdependencies between the individual processes confirms the usefulness of the multivariate setting. Overall, our empirical results confirm theoretical findings on limit order book trading and show that a trader's decision of when and which order to submit is significantly influenced by the queued volume, the market depth, the inside spread, recent volatility, as well as recent changes in both the order flow and the price.",
