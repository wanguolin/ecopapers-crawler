            "abstract": "This paper assesses the possible contemporaneous relationship between stock index prices, earnings and long-term government bond yields for a large number of countries and over a time period that spans several decades. In a cointegration framework, our analysis looks at three hypotheses. First, is there a long-term contemporaneous relationship between earnings, stock prices and government bond yields? Second, does a deviation from this possible long-run equilibrium impact stock prices such that the equilibrium is restored? Third, do government bond yields play a significant role in the long-run relationship or does the latter only involve stock prices and earnings? We also study the short-term impact of changes in long-term government bond yields on stock prices and discuss our short-term and long-term results in light of the recent developments regarding the so-called Fed model.",

            "abstract": "Discretionary accruals are positively associated with stock returns at the aggregate level but negatively so in the cross section. Using Baker-Wurgler investor sentiment index, we find that a significant presence of sentiment-driven investors is important in accounting for both patterns. We document that the aggregate relation is only prominent during periods of high investor sentiment. Similarly, the cross-section relation is considerably stronger in high-sentiment periods in both economic magnitude and statistical significance. We then embed investor sentiment into a stylized model of earnings management, and illustrate that a positive (negative) relationship between stock returns and earnings management can endogenously emerge in the aggregate (cross section). Our analysis suggests that the (discretionary) accrual-return relation at both the aggregate and firm levels at least partially reflects mispricing that is related to market-wide investor sentiment.",

Using data on technology stockholdings of 115 large institutional investors, we test the presence of herding by examining linear dependence and feedback between individual investors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 technology stockholdings and that of the aggregate market. Unlike other models to detect herding, we use Geweke (1982) type causality tests that allow us to disentangle spurious herding from intentional herding via tests of bidirectional and instantaneous causality across portfolio positions in technology stocks. After controlling information based (spurious) herding, our tests show that 38 percent of large institutional investors tend to intentionally herd in technology stocks. The findings support the existing literature that investment decisions by large institutional investors are not only driven by fundamental information, but also by cognitive bias that is characterized by intentional herding.",

            "abstract": "This paper investigates how monetary policy shock affects the stock market of the United States (US) conditional on states of investor sentiment. In this regard, we use a recently developed estimator that uses high-frequency surprises as a proxy for the structural monetary policy shocks, which in turn is achieved by integrating the current short-term rate surprises, which are least affected by an information effect, into a vector autoregressive (VAR) model as an exogenous variable. When allowing for time-varying model parameters, we find that, compared to the low investor sentiment regime, the negative reaction of stock returns to contractionary monetary policy shocks is stronger in the state associated with relatively higher investor optimism. Our results are robust to alternative sample period (which excludes the zero lower bound) and model specification and also have important implications for academicians, investors, and policymakers.",

            "abstract": "We investigate the impact of air quality and weather on the stock market returns of the Shenzhen Exchange. To capture the air quality and weather effects, we apply dummy variables generated by applying a moving average and moving standard deviation. Our study provides several interesting results. First, in the whole sample period (2005\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009c2019), we find that high air pollution and extremely high temperature have significant and negative effects on the Shenzhen stock returns. In the sub-period I (2005\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009c2012), the 11-day model and 31-day model show that high air pollution have significant and negative effects on the Shenzhen stock returns. Second, the results of the quantile regression show that high air pollution have significant and negative effects during bullish market phase, and extremely high temperature have significant and negative effects during bearish market phase. This implies that the air quality and weather effects are asymmetric. Third, the more the Shenzhen stock returns drop, the greater the effect of the abnormal temperature is. Whereas, the more the Shenzhen stock returns increase, the greater the effect of the abnormal air quality is. Fourth, the least squares method underestimates the air quality and weather effects compared to the quantile regression method, suggesting that the quantile regression method is more suitable in analysing these effects in a very volatile emerging market such as the Shenzhen stock market.",

            "abstract": "This paper examines the effects of the announcement of different macroeconomic data on the forint/euro exchange rate and government securities yields. It focuses on establishing whether there is a significant correlation between the size or direction of exchange rate and yield movements and the announcement of macroeconomic data and their news value. The study is based on an analysis of the statistical characteristics of movements following the announcement of data as well as on regression calculations and hypothesis tests. The absolute magnitude of data published has only a slight effect on money markets, whereas the deviation of data from expectations and the surprise element of the information they carry have a significant impact. The reason for this is that expectations relating to new data and the information they provide are constantly being built into market prices and exchange rates. Thus, when the next announcement is made the exchange rate and yields are primarily moved by the surprise components of the data and the extent of surprise they cause. The main direction of the exchange rate and yield movements is determined by expectations on the general state of the economy, and is affected by publication of specific data only temporarily and to a small extent. A permanent shift usually only takes place when several pieces of data reinforce one another and often only following analysis and evaluation of such data, resulting in a time gap after announcement of the actual data. As a result in most cases, correlation between the announcement of macroeconomic data and market yields and the exchange rate can only be observed for a short period of time, as the effect of the announcement is priced out and the exchange rate and yields return to a level justified by the combined effect of other factors defining the economic environment. The forint/euro exchange rate reacts more sensitively than the average to new information related to the consumer price index, GDP growth and the current account balance. Exchange rate movements were explained by the unexpected component of new data in asignificant number of cases. Similarly, a close statistical correlation can be found between the news value of the above three types of data and yield movements. The announcement of new data has an especially significant effect on long-term yields. Publication of other types of data, however, shows no significant correlation with exchange rate and yield movements.",

It examines also whether socially responsible and Islamic investments offer an additional opportunity for domestic investors to diversify their portfolios. Empirical results show that ethical investment ethical investment has inferior performance compared with their unscreened benchmarks. Moreover, using cointegration analysis, empirical results show the absence of long-run relationship between Islamic and conventional indices which offer new potential for portfolio diversification in local markets. However, there exist a long-run relationship between SR indices and their conventional counterparts. In the other hand, cointegration tests show that Islamic and socially responsible indices have long-run relationship only for FTSE indices.",

            "abstract": "There are several financial markets where a few dealers trade a large share of total volume, while also having access to periodic auctions of the same asset conducted by a third party. For such a market, we derive a test of private information about the value of the asset that combines data on both bidding behavior and market trades. Our approach is to test for private versus common values, as defined in auction theory. We use changes in trading prices of extreme bidders before and after the auction to test the null hypothesis of private values (no private information) against the alternative of common values (private information). Additionally, we use a regression discontinuity design where we compare the behavior of dealers bidding right below and right above the auction's cutoff price to control for inventory effects. Our case study are foreign exchange auctions conducted by the Central Bank of Colombia during the period 2008-2014, and the corresponding interdealer market for Colombian Pesos against US dollars. Overall, our test rejects the null hypothesis. Specifically, information revealed to the bidders about their relative valuations has a subsequent effect on trading prices, at an hourly trading window, equivalent to 23% - 39% of the standard deviation of currency prices. **** RESUMEN: Existen varios mercados financieros en los que algunos intermediarios tranzan una gran parte del volumen total, adem\u00c3\u00a1s de tener acceso a subastas peri\u00c3\u00b3dicas del mismo activo realizadas por un tercero. Para dicho mercado, derivamos una prueba de informaci\u00c3\u00b3n privada sobre el valor del activo que combina datos sobre el comportamiento de las pujas y las transacciones de mercado. Nuestro enfoque es probar valores privados versus valores comunes, tal como se define en la teor\u00c3\u00ada de subastas. Utilizamos cambios en los precios de mercado de los postores extremos antes y despu\u00c3\u00a9s de la subasta para probar la hip\u00c3\u00b3tesis nula de valores privados (sin informaci\u00c3\u00b3n privada) frente a la alternativa de valores comunes (informaci\u00c3\u00b3n privada). Adem\u00c3\u00a1s, utilizamos un dise\u00c3\u00b1o de regresi\u00c3\u00b3n discontinua en el que comparamos el comportamiento de los postores que ofertan justo debajo y encima del precio de corte de la subasta para controlar por posibles efectos de inventario. Nuestro caso de estudio son las subastas de divisas realizadas por el Banco de la Rep\u00c3\u00bablica de Colombia durante el periodo 2008-2014, y el mercado cambiario correspondiente de pesos-d\u00c3\u00b3lar. En general, nuestra prueba rechaza la hip\u00c3\u00b3tesis nula. En particular, la informaci\u00c3\u00b3n revelada a los postores sobre sus valoraciones relativas tiene un efecto sobre los precios de mercado, en una ventana de una hora, equivalente al 23% - 39% de la desviaci\u00c3\u00b3n est\u00c3\u00a1ndar de los precios de las divisas.",

We study this stylized fact for the case of a major German stock index, the DAX, by recovering index implied volatility from simulating the 30 dimensional return system of all DAX constituents. Option prices are computed after risk neutralization of the multivariate process which is estimated under the physical probability measure. The multivariate models belong to the class of copula asymmetric dynamic conditional correlation models. We show that moderate tail-dependence coupled with asymmetric correlation response to negative news is essential to explain the index implied volatility skew. Standard dynamic correlation models with zero tail-dependence fail to generate a sufficiently steep implied volatility skew.",
