            "title": "Lottery preferences and retail short selling",
            "abstract": "Unlike developed countries, the prominent participants in the Taiwanese stock market are individual investors. This study found that retail short-sellers in Taiwan can predict stock prices and perform better with stocks held primarily by retail investors with a preference for lottery-like payoffs. Moreover, short-sellers make lower profits with stocks with lottery features in the absence of the uptick rule. The findings are robust when considering the effect of institutional short selling, alternative lottery-like measures such as retail trading activity, arbitrage risk, and distinct macroeconomic conditions. Overall, the results suggest that retail investors are not necessarily noise traders. Based on divergence-of-opinion theory (Miller, 1977), heterogeneous retail investors make trades due to their differences in sentiments. Meanwhile, retail short-sellers include professionals in profitmaking through short-selling by gauging the gambling propensity of general retail investors. Consequently, removing short-selling restrictions can increase the spillover effect of short-sellers' trading signals and help other retail investors move and adjust their investments in lottery-like stocks.",

            "abstract": "This work studies the returns to technical trading rules utilising a sample of 14 currency pairs by applying five trading rules: Filter rules, Trading Range Breakout, Moving Average, and Bollinger bands over varying market conditions. The mixed results indicate that technical analysis based on the applied trading rules is appropriate for the trading strategies examined. The one per cent filter, 150-day MA rule and the Bollinger bands trading rule surpassed the other applied techniques in general performance. What is also clear is that these trading rules are rewarding over varying market conditions. Results from various subperiods, representing normal and stressful market conditions, generally confirm our main findings and show the added value of the trading range breakout rule, which delivers performance in strongly trending markets. Evidence from bootstrap analysis demonstrates the predictive ability of the Moving Average and Bollinger band trading rules.",

            "abstract": "Brownian-motion-linked pricing models predict the existence of derivatives whose value at risk in short positions is lower than their price. The derivative sale plus the price investment in riskless assets becomes self-financing with negative risk. Repeating over and over this strategy, the price remains zero, but the risk tends to minus infinity. This paper reports results of empirical studies about the performance of this strategy. The American SP-500 and the German DAX-30 are involved. In both cases the index is beaten by simple buy and hold strategies containing riskless assets and short options. This finding may be interesting to practitioners and theoretically relevant. Firstly, the market can be beaten in an orthodox way, since results of Financial Economics inspire the methodology. Secondly, the risk never tends to minus infinity in practice. Perhaps the theoretical behavior in tails of Brownian-motion-linked models should be revisited.",

            "abstract": "This study explores the impact of China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s high-speed rail network on reducing local bias and fostering capital market integration. Our research reveals that implementing high-speed rail in a city decreases the return comovement of its local stocks but increases its return comovement with the national stock market. Our results are robust and consistent across various model specifications. After examining the underlying economic mechanism, we find that the impact of high-speed rail on stock return comovement is stronger for small firms, non-state-owned enterprises (non-SOEs), firms with poor corporate governance, and firms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 headquarters in more segmented and less-developed regions. This effect did not change after controlling for other information-dissemination channels and regional economic development. Overall, geographical proximity contributes to information transfer and market efficiency.",

            "abstract": "Corporate advertising is a type of soft information that may not directly target the financial markets but may attract investors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 attention. In this study, we consider television advertisements (TV ads) as soft information, whereas corporate news via disclosure and mass media as hard news. We explore the interactive effect of TV ads (soft information) with corporate news (hard news) on stock market outcomes. Based on daily market data with the multi-dimensional information sources, we find that TV ads significantly increase trading volume and returns, conditional on less corporate news being released. Our evidence supports the information substitution hypothesis that TV ads compete with corporate news owing to investors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 limited attention, while rejecting the complementary relationship between soft and hard information.",

In recent months, fan tokens have been among the most popular digital assets among football clubs and investor fans. Therefore, understanding the dynamics and spillover effects between these new and traditional assets is essential for risk management. In this study, we use daily data covering November 2020 and December 2022 to examine the mean and volatility risks spillover between the stock market and the fan token ones. Using the VAR-BEEK-AGARCH model and wavelet frequency analysis, we are able to identify the sender and receiver characteristics of the risks between the two assets. Our results show that volatility spillovers are more persistent in the long run, suggesting a strong interdependence between the stock market and fan tokens. Our empirical findings can be helpful for portfolio managers and investors.",

By using a sample of Chinese A-share manufacturing firms listed on the Shanghai stock exchange and Shenzhen stock exchange between 2009 and 2017, we find that customer stock returns positively predict firm stock returns in the subsequent month. Additional examinations reveal that the positive predictive effect of customer stock returns on firm stock returns is more intense for firm with high proportion of state-owned customers, customer stability, customer bargaining power and customer concentration than for those with low indicators. Overall, this study contributes to the growing literature on supply chain and predictability of stock returns by shedding light on the forecasting effect of customer stock returns on firm stock returns and the predictive heterogeneity owing to customer characteristics.",

It also finds that the positive effects on stock returns are not temporary but remain for the long term although some reversals occur. The results show that the effects of search intensity on stock returns are higher for large stocks than for small stocks. The findings also reveal that stocks that attract more attention from the public are exposed to higher market risk.

In contrast with the recent literature showing that pair-trading strategy returns are insignificant and negative in the Taiwan stock market, we find that the profitabilities of pair trades developed by positions in the Taiwan 50 Index during 1990/1\u00e2\u0080\u00932016/3 present significant annualized mean returns of 1.84%\u00e2\u0080\u00933.04%. Moreover, thresholds with different stringent degrees, industry boundary, and alternative reinvestment mechanisms are unable to help pick out more profitable pair-trading portfolios. The distance filter and shorter trading-day setting are more reliable for pair trading. Finally, the deregulation on short selling results in more pair-trading activities, which obviously diminish the profitability of a pair-trading strategy.",

Second, negative weekly returns increase in trading the constituent stocks of DJ30 and FTSE100 because returns increase considerably on golden-cross days as a result of stock price overreaction.
