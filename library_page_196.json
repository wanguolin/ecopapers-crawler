            "abstract": "Using a new data set on investor sentiment we show that institutional and individual sentiment proxy for smart money and noise trader risk, respectively. First, using bias-adjusted long-horizon regressions, we document that institutional sentiment forecasts stock market returns at intermediate horizons correctly, whereas individuals consistently get the direction wrong. Second, VEC models show that institutional sentiment forecasts mean-reversion whereas individuals forecast trend continuation. Finally, institutional investors take into account expected individual sentiment when forming their expectations in a way that higher (lower) expected sentiment of individuals lowers (increases) institutional return forecasts. Individuals neglect the information contained in institutional sentiment.",

If we consider, however, risk in higher-order statistical moments, momentum returns appear less advantageous. Thus, a prospect-theoretical assessment of US stock momentum returns provides a possible direction for explaining this puzzle.",

            "abstract": "We analyse daily lead-lag patterns in US equity and credit default swap (CDS) returns. We first document that equity returns robustly lead CDS returns. However, we find that the CDS-lag is due to common (and not firm-specific) news and arises predominantly in response to positive (instead of negative) equity market news. We provide an explanation for this news-specific price discovery based on dealers in the CDS market exploiting their informational advantage vis-\u00c3 -vis institutional investors with hedging demands. In support of this explanation we find that the CDS-lag and its news-specificity are related to various firm-level proxies for hedging demand in the cross-section as well measures for economy-wide informational asymmetries over time.",

            "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel model to analyse the impact of macroeconomic shocks on volatility spillovers within key financial markets, such as Stock, Bond, Gold and Crude Oil. By treating macroeconomic variables as external factors to financial market volatility, our study distinguishes between internal financial volatility spillovers and external shocks arising from macroeconomic changes. Our analysis reveals that without macroeconomic shocks, the Stock market predominantly acts as the main source of volatility spillovers, with Crude Oil being the principal spillover recipient. However, the Stock market\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s role in driving volatility spillover, especially towards the Crude Oil market, changes markedly in the context of macroeconomic shocks. These shocks exert a more substantial impact on Crude Oil compared to other markets. In contrast, the Bond and Gold markets exhibit a lower level of volatility transmission and are less influenced by macroeconomic shocks, thereby reinforcing their roles as stabilizers within the financial system.",

            "abstract": "This paper applies the threshold quantile autoregressive model to study stock return autocorrelations and predictability in the Chinese stock market from 2005 to 2014. The results show that the Shanghai A-share stock index has significant negative autocorrelations in the lower regime and has significant positive autocorrelations in the higher regime. It attributes that Chinese investors overreact and underreact in two different states. These results are similar when we employ individual stocks. Besides, we investigate stock return autocorrelations by different stock characteristics, including liquidity, volatility, market to book ratio and investor sentiment. The results show autocorrelations are significantly large in the middle and higher regimes of market to book ratio and volatility. Psychological biases can result into return autocorrelations by using investor sentiment proxy since autocorrelations are significantly larger in the middle and higher regime of investor sentiment. The empirical results show that predictability exists in the Chinese stock market.",

            "abstract": "Even though volatility spillover effects in global equity markets have been documented extensively, the transmission of illiquidity across national borders has not. In this paper, we propose a multiplicative error model (MEM) for the dynamics of illiquidity. We empirically study the illiquidity and volatility spillover effects in eight developed equity markets during and after the recent financial crisis. The results indicate that equity markets are interdependent, both in terms of volatility and illiquidity. Most markets show an increase in volatility and illiquidity spillover effects during the crisis. Furthermore, we find volatility and illiquidity transmission are highly relevant. Illiquidity is a more important channel than volatility in propagating the shocks in equity markets. Our results show an overall crucial role for illiquidity in the US market in influencing other equity markets illiquidity and volatility. These findings are of importance for policy makers as well as institutional and private investors.",

For the period 2010-2017, we test ETFs for price inefficiency (existence of deviations between prices and the Net Asset Value) and persistence. We find that the studied ETF does not always outperform index funds in replicating the variations of the PSI 20 index, despite exhibiting better tracking ability when facing downside deviations of the benchmark and a better capacity of smoothing tracking deviations. Regarding ETFs price efficiency and its persistence, the study reveals that the examined ETF is priced at a low average discount with evidence of deviations persistence of at least two days. The investment schemes with the highest ability to track the PSI 20 Index were PSI20 (ETF), BBVA PPA \u00c3\u008dndice PSI20, and the equity mutual fund BPI Portugal.",

Using daily sovereign bond data, our analysis shows that trend components of both types of risk are strongly positively correlated. Vector auto-regression and generalized impulse response analysis reveal that shocks to the SLR has significant impact on SYR lasting up to 5 days, whereas shocks to the SYR has no significant impact on SLR. Since mid-2015, both risks are gradually increasing and as of 2018, they are at their highest levels over the last five years.",

I deploy recent nonlinear techniques for detecting publication bias together with Bayesian and frequentist model averaging to evaluate the heterogeneity in the estimates. The results yield three key conclusions. First, publication bias distorts the findings of the primary studies. After this bias is corrected, the literature shows that with higher trading volume, returns decline in both effects in the contemporaneous and even in the dynamic one. Second, one cannot rely on any general conclusions about stock markets. The predictability of stock returns varies with different markets and stock types. Third, different data characteristics, structural variations and methodologies used drive the heterogeneity in the results of the primary articles. In particular, one should be cautious when using monthly data or VAR models.",

This strongly contrasts with 1.4 bps returns for non-announcement days. We further measure the individual stocks\u00c2\u00b4 sensitivities to macroeconomic data announcements over various lookback periods and show that stocks in the high-sensitivity portfolios offer investors significantly higher returns than stocks in the low-sensitivity portfolios. The average returns on the difference portfolios amount to 18 bps per month for the 60-month sensitivities. The Fama-MacBeth regression coefficients for the announcement sensitivity are positive and statistically significant across all lookback periods.",

The relationship disappears for illiquid stock pairs, whereas it strengthens when short positions originate from informed agents, such as hedge funds, active investors, and short sellers with high past performance. This supports the hypothesis that the relationship is driven by information, rather than by price pressure. We show that these results can be used to obtain diversification benefits.",

            "abstract": "Heterogeneous agents' model with the stochastic beliefs formation is considered. Fundamentalists rely on their model employing fundamental information basis to forecast the next price period. Chartists determine whether current conditions call for the acquisition of fundamental information in a forward looking manner rather than relying on the past performance. It was shown that implementation of the agents memory can significantly change the preferences of trader strategies. The Worst out Algorithm (WOA) is used with considered heterogeneous agents\u00e2\u0080\u0099 model to simulate more realistic market conditions. The WOA replaces periodically the trading strategy that has the lowest performance level of all strategies presented on the market by the new one. The memory length of the new strategy that enters the market has the same stochastic structure as the initial strategies. This paper shows an influence of the agent memory as a stochastic process on the heterogeneous agents model with the WOA. Simulations show difference in price returns behaviour between two types of agents\u00e2\u0080\u0099 memory length distribution functions (Uniform and Normal). There is a significant difference in the values of the Hurst exponent and the variance in these two cases. A lower Hurst exponent in the uniform case is caused by a richer spectrum of agents\u00e2\u0080\u0099 memory length, because agents are equally distributed across all trading horizons. For the uniform case there is no opportunity for any prediction. On the other hand, the value of the Hurst exponent gives a signal for a possibility of the price prediction in the normal case.",
