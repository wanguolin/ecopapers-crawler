            "abstract": "This paper explores the effects of domestic and US macroeconomic announcement on the Romanian stock market. We found that some domestic macroeconomic announcement linked by the monetary policy had a consistent influence on the stock prices evolution. We also identify that some US macroeconomic news have a significant impact on the Romanian stock exchange, a fact explained by the linkages between the Romanian stock market and the international financial markets.",

            "title": "Overreaction and underreaction on the BUCHAREST STOCK EXCHANGE",
            "abstract": "Efficient Market Hypothesis states that financial markets react instantaneous and unbiased to new information. However, in the last decades empirical researches revealed some anomalies in investors reactions to the events that caused shocks on the financial markets. There are two main hypotheses to describe such behaviors. The first one - Overreaction Hypothesis stipulates that investors overreact on the day when a shock occurs and they correct on the next days by opposite actions. The second one - Underreaction Hypothesis considers that investors underreact on the day of a shock and they apply corrections on the next days by opposite actions. These behaviors are influenced by the nature of events that cause shocks and by some characteristics of the financial markets. In this paper we explore the short-term reactions that followed positive and negative shocks from the Romanian capital market, using daily values of the main indexes from the Bucharest Stock Exchange for a period of time between January 2005 and March 2011. Depending on the horizons taken into consideration and on the nature of the shocks we find evidences for the Efficient Market Hypothesis, Overreaction Hypothesis and the Underreaction Hypothesis. We also find that actual global crisis caused significant changes in the investors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 reactions to the shocks.",

Our investigation employs data from the prices in the Romanian national currency, of the two main currencies used in the financial transactions: euro and US dollar. For the euro we find evidence of a Monday effect between January 2005 and June 2007, no DOW effect between July 2007 and September 2008, a Tuesday effect between October 2008 and April 2009 and a Thursday effect between May 2009 and February 2010. For the US dollar we identify only a Tuesday effect between October 2008 and April 2009. We relate these changes with the consequences of the Romania\u00e2\u0080\u0099s adhesion to the European Union and with the effects of the global crisis.",

A sample model is proposed, which extends an existing strategy through HFT means like time slicing with random splitting of the order volume and time shifting. As this strategy brings some information asymmetry to the trading parties, a general question about its impact on market benefit is raised and proposed for further academic research.",

The Chilean Stock market has grown consistently over the last 40 years and is now the second largest equity market in South America behind that of Brazil. Using a recently available dataset for the most actively traded stocks, we examine the patterns of intraday volatility. We show that intraday volatility declines during the day with an accentuation at the end of trading for the stocks we examine. We document the necessity of an opening auction system for the market and justify the benefits of the proactive implementation of a closing call auction system by exchange regulators in February 2019. Showing evidence that periods of efficiency alternate with periods with lack thereof, we provide suggestions as to when different types of traders should participate during the trading session.",

The creation of the new sector had a significant impact on REITs included in the new Real Estate sector. Prior to the event date, REITs experienced significant negative returns. But after the event date, REITs also experienced significant positive returns which dissipated over time. The returns prior to (after) the event date would have resulted in a retail investor incurring losses (gains). While the magnitude of the trading volume increased noticeably prior to the event date, overall trading volume was not discernibly impacted.",

            "abstract": "Abstract In this paper we explore the profit-taking tactics employed by informed traders when there are informational asymmetries across investors. Our laboratory is Tradesports, which until 2015 operated a double auction exchange where participants traded binary options contracts. This venue is a close analog to stock markets and, because each contract\u00e2\u0080\u0099s value is unambiguously revealed, the joint hypothesis problem is mitigated. We demonstrate that when the ratio of noise traders to sophisticated traders is highest, shares are most overpriced. Data show that informed traders heavily target noise traders when liquidity is high, and in conducting profit-taking operations they prefer to short sell via small transactions and round lots. Results suggest that, even in the absence of liquidity constraints and certain costs and risks related to short selling, the relative complexity of short selling can itself lead to overpricing.",
