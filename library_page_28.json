In contrast to previous studies, it reveals that such strategies generated statistically significant negative returns during the most recent recessions. These \u00e2\u0080\u009cmomentum crashes\u00e2\u0080\u009d happen during market reversals following exceptionally large market declines, as occurred in March and April 2009.",

This paper investigates how rates of return are associated with the timing of a bet and the amount staked in a pari-mutuel horse betting market. We employ a novel data set measured at the level of individual bettors on the Finnish monopoly operator\u00e2\u0080\u0099s online platform. Our findings suggest that, relative to other bets, late high-stakes wagers are more profitable. This implies that, along with timing, bet sizes should be accounted for when analysing market efficiency.",

The firms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 optimality condition predicts that expected stock returns equal investment returns (the ratio of expected marginal benefits of investment to marginal costs of investment). We show that the investment model does a good job in explaining the dispersion portfolios. Firms with high forecast dispersion have low expected profitability, which is a key component of expected marginal benefit of investment. Consequently, high forecast dispersion portfolio earns lower expected returns. Our results suggest that the dispersion anomaly could be consistent with the firms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 value maximization.",

Investors can earn a sizeable premium of about 8% and 12% per annum by exploiting the energy futures contract risk associated with the hedgers' net positions and roll-yield characteristics, respectively, in line with predictions from the hedging pressure hypothesis and theory of storage. Simultaneously exploiting various signals towards style-integration with alternative weighting schemes further enhances the premium. In particular, the style-integrated portfolio that equally weights all signals stands out as the most effective. The findings are robust to transaction costs, data mining and sub-period analyses.",

In particular factor loadings are higher when the factor returns during the ranking period are higher. In this study we look at momentum returns after hedging these time-varying exposures to the Fama and French factors. We find that specifically taking into account the conditional nature of the time-variation in factor loadings is the best way to hedge. The hedged momentum returns are higher, less risky, more stable over time and vary less over different market conditions. Determining momentum betas based on estimated individual stock betas leads to systematic biases and hence is less effective in hedging.",

We study the time-series of trading activity in the cash S&P 500 index and its derivatives (options, the legacy and E-mini futures contracts, and the ETF), and consider their dynamic relation with the macroeconomy, over more than 3000 trading days during 1997\u00e2\u0080\u00932009. Legacy futures volume has trended downward while other series have trended upward. Total futures volume has increased, suggesting that the trading in the legacy contract has been at least partially supplanted by trading in the E-mini contract. All series are highly cross-correlated and jointly dependent. Signed and absolute trading activity in contingent claims (most prominently, options) predicts shifts in aggregate state variables such as the short interest rate, and the term and credit spreads, as well as signed and absolute returns around major macroeconomic announcements. Overall, consistent with the informational role of options, their volume innovations have the strongest forecasting ability for fluctuations in the macroeconomic environment.",
