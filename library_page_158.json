            "title": "Month Related Seasonality on the Macedonian Stock Market",
            "abstract": "A consistent theme in the market efficiency literature has concerned the presence of calendar anomalies or seasonality in stock market returns. Whereas calendar anomalies in advanced equity markets have been investigated extensively, the stock markets in the transition economies have received less attention. This research examines the month-of-the-year effect on Macedonian Stock Exchange using a simple single ANOVA model and regression-based approach. If there is evidence of existence of predictable pattern or market inefficiency, then investors can have opportunity to generate abnormal returns by forecasting of the predictable movements in asset prices. The results indicate that there is evidence of month of the year effect. ANOVA model rejected the null of equality in the monthly returns during the year, and dummy variable regression model using OLS methodology found that returns are significantly lower in November. These findings can be useful for the investors trading on the Macedonian Stock Exchange.",

            "abstract": "The traditional Capital Asset Pricing Model stating that the risk premium of a financial asset is positively related to its market risk, was found to be insufficient in explaining the expected returns of stocks. Fama and French (1993) introduced the \u00e2\u0080\u009cThree-Factor Asset Pricing Model\u00e2\u0080\u009d via inserting the size and book-to-market factors to the standard Capital Asset Pricing Model. In this study, the validity of the Three-Factor Model in Istanbul Stock Exchange within 1999-2011 period is investigated. The model is tested on ISE-100 Index non-financial companies monthly data by utilizing panel data analysis. The findings reveal that Three-Factor Model gives statistically significant results in Istanbul Stock Exchange. In the forecast of the cost of capital, Three-Factor Model can be used instead of one-factor Capital Asset Pricing Model by the investors in Turkey. Our findings are consistent with most of the studies that suggested the validity of the Three-Factor Model in developed and emerging markets.",

            "abstract": "This paper provides new evidence to compare the information content of model-free implied volatility (MFIV) and model-based volatility for forecasting future volatility of the S&P 500. We choose Black and Scholes (BS) implied volatility as our model-based volatility and VIX as our measure of MFIV. By using non-overlapping monthly samples from January 2004 to June 2019, we find that both BS implied volatility and MFIV are informationally efficient and subsume information contained in the historical realized volatility for forecasting future volatility. This is the first study show that BS implied volatility and MFIV contain the same information and there is no winner for forecasting future volatility. This implied that a forecast model could include both BS implied volatility and MFIV",

            "abstract": "Romanian currency market considering the episodic character of linear and/or nonlinear dependencies, between 1999 and 2008. The main conclusion is that profitability of moving average strategies is not constant over time and that is mainly due to linear and nonlinear episodic dependencies. The trading rule profits did not declined over time in the case of the Romanian currency market. Exploring the causes of profitability, it was found that it was closely related to the intensity of manifestation of episodic linear and nonlinear dependencies, the state of the market, and it was not the result of a time varying risk premium. The empirical results are consistent with the Adaptive Markets Hypothesis (Lo, 2004), but not with the Efficient Market Hypothesis.",

Our empirical results reveal a positive (negative) relationship between news sentiment and cumulative abnormal returns in the pre- (post-) earnings announcement period, thereby confirming that the market response takes into consideration all relevant information on the related firm. The application of public news sentiment to portfolio management indicates that long (short) stocks with low (high) news sentiment and high public news surprises will earn positive excess returns. We suggest that the relevant news of individual stocks could be applied to the prediction of abnormal returns and portfolio management.",

Our findings indicate that the US stock price-dividend is a nonlinear series that is characterized by a unit root process in a particular month; the stock price-dividend ratio shows a decrease by more than 7.17% between the previous year and the previous fourth month.",

            "abstract": "There is a large and growing literature that criticizes the random walk assumption of the Gaussian distribution and the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) as well. In this respect, the Fractal Market Hypothesis (FMH) is an alternative approach to the EMH. On the other hand, Credit Default Swaps (CDSs) are also taken as an indicator of risk. It is a puzzle for the researchers whether CDS spreads are following a random walk process or not. The aim of this study is to investigate the validity of the FMH in CDS spreads for 34 OECD countries between March 2003 and February 2020. The rescaled range analysis is used for each country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s data with four different frequencies. The results show that there is a persistency in all CDS spreads. That process, called the Hurst process, indicates that the Fractal Market Hypothesis is valid in the CDS spreads.",

This extensive investment plan targeted the rejuvenation of the dynamics of investments across the European Union and quickly became a topic of interest for both political authorities and academics. In this paper we aim to fill a gap in the existing literature and investigate the reaction of financial markets to the information regarding the Investment Plan.

The results point out to clear influences on all of the three classes of financial assets included in the study, which could be seen as a shift in investors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 expectations, given that the effects of the proposed policies are likely to be noticed in the long run.",

The Bogot\u00c3\u00a1 Stock Exchange was established in 1928. However, the two other main bourses in the country merged with this in 2001 to create the CSE. Since then, the CSE is becoming a good diversification alternative for both domestic and foreign investors. The modelling in the study begins with linear regression analyses, but the data generating process is shown to be non-linear. A non-linear GARCH model is then applied, achieving a good explanation for the modelled rates of return. Results obtained indicate the significant presence of day of the week effects in both returns and volatility. The maximum return is on Friday whereas the minimum is on Tuesday, with return variances at their highest on Monday.",
