            "abstract": "The second order stochastic dominance (SSD) has become exceedingly popular in recent years,due to its ability to determine the dominance of one asset over another for all risk-averse investorswithout a strict requirement in asset distribution. In this study, 33 OECD country indexes and theirenriched set of assets, which consists of some combinations of these indexes, are investigatedand compared between 2007 and 2015 by utilizing pairwise SSD comparisons, with different datafrequencies, such as daily, weekly, monthly and quarterly. This paper contributes to the literaturein three points: Firstly, a serious portion of the best performing OECD countries has the lowest GDP(PPP) per capita level. Secondly, the SSD efficient set depends on data frequency. Thirdly, whenthe data frequency is lowered, the difference between two SSD pairwise efficiency tests decreases.",

            "abstract": "The efficient markets hypothesis provides a theoretical basis on which technical trading rules (TTRs) are rejected as a viable trading strategy. TTRs, providing a signal to the user when to buy or sell asset based on such price patterns, should not be useful for generating excess returns. Technical traders tend to put little faith in strict efficient markets hypothesis. This approach relies on heterogeneity in the agent information and subsequent decisions either as fundamentalists or as technical traders. Switching between the technical trader's and fundamentalist's strategy is a basis of the cycle behaviour. This event is analysed by the Brock and Hommes (BH) model. Moreover, the memory case is added to this model because BH model was the memory-less model. This branch consists of a behaviour analysis among fundamentalists and technical traders. Here is a basis for endogenous source of the real business cycle.",

            "abstract": "This paper carried out two main studies: Part 1 attempted to conduct a set of tests for weak form efficiency (WFE); Part 2 tried to estimate day of the week effect using GARCH and EGARCH models. The principal objective of this paper, hence, is to test the weak-form efficiency for selected three stocks (Molex Incorporated, Monro Muffler Brake, Inc., and Monterey Gourmet Foods, Inc.) and two stock indices (NYSE/AMEX/NASDAQ index capitalisation-based Deciles 1 and 10). As for Part I, this paper identified that there are negative trends on Monday and Wednesday and positive trends are found on Friday. This result also follows the general finding of existing literature. Likewise, the results for Part II showed that Monday, Wednesday, and Friday had negative trends although the sizes of coefficients are small. In addition, different from aforementioned three, returns on Tuesday is significant and positive. Overall, the results seem to provide ample evidence of day of the week effect on stock market volatility.",

            "abstract": "In a recent article, Ederington (1979) examined the hedging performance of financial futures markets using a portfolio model derived from the hedging theories of Stein (1961) and Johnson (1960). His article concluded that GNMA futures were more effective than T-Bill futures in reducing price change risk. Moreover, in the short term, the performance of T-Bill futures in reducing risk was extremely poor. The purpose of this article is to determine whether these results are due to a misspecification of the model and to test whether the hedging effectiveness of the T-Bill futures market has changed after three years of trading. A portfolio model of hedging effectiveness is formulated to account for the constant yield price accumulation over time on Treasury bills as distinguished from price changes due to instantaneous changes in yield. We test the T-Bill futures market using the portfolio model and conclude that the market provides very good opportunities for hedging, provided that the spot position is comprised of Treasury bills deliverable against the futures contract.",

            "abstract": "In a world characterized by the occurrence of uncontrollable and extreme events investors are often required to make decisions on the basis of the available information. The challenge they face is how to manipulate these information sets in order to get what can lead them to the optimal decision. This logical way of thinking allows us to face two major ideas. The first idea is that each one of us has his own way to see the world and his own utility function that he will try to maximize. The second is where each one seeking to maximize his utility function is intuitively constrained to minimize the risk. The means that can combine these two aims is a well-defined investment process. Through this paper work we tried to summarize around 26 years of experience of a group of traders and investment advisors. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s common to all of them is the definition of some standardized rules that must be followed but each one can adapt them to his proper needs and preferences.",

            "abstract": "In a recent article, Puglisi developed and tested a model for evaluating the efficiency of the Treasury bill futures market. He found that the market for Treasury bill futures was not efficient because arbitrage opportunities existed involving transactions in futures and outstanding Treasury bills, although such opportunities have ebbed as the market continued to mature. This paper shows that the summary statistics reported by Puglisi are misleading and may be misinterpreted, that the Treasury bill futures market may be used to increase returns, and that the spot and futures market must be evaluated for such purposes only on a daily basis.",

            "abstract": "Until the existence of financial futures, testing the determinants and the informational content of futures market prices has been difficult because of the vagaries associated with commodity markets. In the case of Treasury bill futures, the existence of an active secondary market and the resulting term structure of interest rates enables one to test alternative hypotheses about the prices of futures contracts. This study compares two alternative specifications of equilibrium futures prices, i.e., those implied by carrying charges and those derived from the unbiased expectations hypothesis of the theory of the term structure of interest rates. In general, the results show that the overnight cost-of-carry model is better for explaining futures prices than are forward rates derived from the yield curve.",

Investors think that they are right at first, but over time realize that they are wrong. The speed of the realization depends on investor confidence in own beliefs and arrival of new information. The model provides a tractable and clear link for how changing opinions translate into equilibrium dynamics for price, holdings, and expected profits. I am able to generate a wide range of realistic market behaviors, including momentum and reversals, as well as support and resistance levels in prices due to investors being reluctant to admit they are wrong.",

Then, we attempt to link these abnormal returns to firms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 characteristics. We find evidence that the announcement of the CPTPP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s approval is associated with positive abnormal returns for Vietnam\u00e2\u0080\u0099s listed firms. We also find considerable heterogeneity in the magnitude and pace of the impacts of the CPTPP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s approval on market returns across Vietnam\u00e2\u0080\u0099s two stock exchanges.

But various anomalies such as day or intra-day effect which are frequently observed at the stock markets provide some abnormal returns to investors. In the literature, many studies have found various anomalies for different national and international stock markets. But most of the applied studies used aggregate data in their econometric analysis. The question is whether the same anomalies exist in sub-indexes such as communication, technology, sports and services, etc. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether there are the same anomalies such as intra-day effect and day of the week effect for an aggregated index and 23 sub-indexes of Borsa Istanbul. The data which used in this study is daily and covers the period of 2005-2015 for Turkey. Findings show that there is evidence for intra-day effect in all 24 indexes and day of the week effect in 2 sub-indexes.",
