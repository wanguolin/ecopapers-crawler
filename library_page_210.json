            "abstract": "The goal of this study is to investigate the causality relationship between the Utilities industry and the nine other industries. Previous literatures show that volatility of stock prices is informative; Granger causality is applied in this research by using of a leveraged bootstrap test developed by Hacker and Hatemi-J (2006) to examine the behavior of the volatility. The results indicate that causality of the volatility of the Utilities industry on the volatility of seven other industries, except the Information Technology and Telecommunication Services industries. The data also suggest that Financials industry has impact on the Utilities industry.",

            "title": "Timing Games with Irrational Types: Leverage-Driven Bubbles and Crash-Contingent Claims",
            "abstract": "This study investigates strategic aspect of leverage-driven bubbles from the viewpoint of game theory and behavioral finance. Even if a company is unproductive, its stock price grows up according to an exogenous reinforcement pattern. During the bubble, this company raises huge funds by issuing new shares. Multiple arbitrageurs strategically decide whether to ride the bubble by continuing to purchase shares through leveraged finance. We demonstrate two models that are distinguished by whether crash-contingent claim, i. e. contractual agreement such that the purchaser of this claim receives a promised monetary amount if and only if the bubble crashes, is available. We show that the availability of this claim deters the bubble; without crash-contingent claim, the bubble emerges and persists long even if the degree of reinforcement is insufficient. Without crash-contingent claim, high leverage ratio fosters the bubble, while with crash-contingent claim, it rather deters the bubble. We formulate these models as specifications of timing game with irrational types; each player selects a time in a fixed time interval, and the player who selects the earliest time wins the game. We assume that each player is irrational with a small but positive probability. We then prove that there exists the unique Nash equilibrium; according to it, every player never selects the initial time. By regarding arbitrageurs as players, we give careful conceptualizations that are necessary to interpret timing games as models of leverage-driven bubbles.",

            "abstract": "A classic result by Merton (1973) is that, except just before expiration or dividend payments, one should never exercise a call option and never convert a convertible bond. We show theoretically that this result is overturned when investors face frictions. Early option exercise can be optimal when it reduces short-sale costs, transaction costs, or funding costs. We provide consistent empirical evidence, documenting billions of dollars of early exercise for options and convertible bonds using unique data on actual exercise decisions and frictions. Our model can explain as much as 98% of early exercises by market makers and 67% by customers.",

            "abstract": "The stability of the EMS depends crucially on the realignment expectations of market participants. In this paper we discuss how to measure such expectations and how to relate them to economic fundamentals, central bank reputation, and the institutional arrangements of the EMS. We find the following empirical regularities for FF/DM and IL/DM exchange rates: (1) expected devaluations are positively related to the current exchange rate deviation from the central parity; (2) expected devaluations are negatively related to the length of time since last realignment in the short and medium run; (3) the Basle-Nyborg agreements seem to have a stabilizing effect for both currencies examined, albeit through different channels; (4) large revaluation expectations occur immediately after devaluations. (1) and (4) are not inconsistent with the hypothesis of `over-speculation' or market inefficiency.",

            "abstract": "Previous studies have documented the existence of a relationship between air pollution and people's moods and between people's moods and stock returns. To investigate if the link between local air pollution and domestic equity returns is mediated by the trading floor community, we use the transition of Italy's main stock exchange from a trading floor technology to an electronic and delocalized trading system as a natural experiment. In addition, we take advantage of differences in trading technology across a sample of major international stock exchanges. In both instances, we document the existence of an air pollution effect only when trading is conducted on the floor, which provides evidence in support of the view that the air pollution effect is at least partly mediated by the behavior of the trading floor community.",

We use textual analysis techniques to measure the tonality of the FOMC minutes\u00e2\u0080\u0099 text and show that a more optimistic tonality has a positive impact on stock returns. This positive effect is prevalent during times of high monetary policy uncertainty and comes mainly from the effect tonality has on risk premium and growth expectations. Our results show that the FOMC minutes are an effective central bank communication tool, particularly during times of high policy uncertainty.",

            "abstract": "This paper provides a mispricing-based explanation for the negative relation between firm-level productivity and stock returns. Investors appear to underprice unproductive firms and overprice productive firms. We find evidence consistent with the speculative overpricing of productive firms driven by investor sentiment and short sale constraints. Investors erroneously extrapolate past productivity growth and its associated operating performance and stock returns, despite their subsequent reversals. Such mispricing is perpetuated because of limits to arbitrage and is partially corrected around earnings announcements when investors are surprised by unexpected earnings news. Decomposition analysis indicates that extrapolative mispricing and limits to arbitrage explain most of the return predictability of firm-level productivity.",
