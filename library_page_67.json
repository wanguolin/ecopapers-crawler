            "title": "The Impact of US Macroeconomic News on the Prices of Single Stocks on the Vienna Stock Exchange",
            "abstract": "Recent studies have shown that announcements of information about the state of the US economy have had a significant impact on European stock markets. However, the importance of information about the US economy may vary in time. In order to analyze this issue, we examine the impact of announcements of unexpected US macroeconomic news on the prices of selected stocks listed on the Vienna Stocks Exchange. On the basis of the 5-minute returns of 13 stocks we examine how the strength and the significance of the reactions of investors to unexpected macroeconomic news from the US has changed over the last 15 years. Event study methodology allows us to describe precisely such reactions in the first minutes after news announcements.",

            "abstract": "This study thoroughly analyzes the stock market efficiency hypothesis - its weak form - in the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary in 1995-2005. It aims to reveal whether trading on historical information about stock prices or indices may lead to economically significant abnormal profits and whether the analyzed markets are comparably efficient. It also tests relative efficiency of the Central European markets compared to developed capital markets that are considered the most effective - the American NYSE, German and Netherlands stock exchanges. Complexity of the results is enhanced by analyzing daily, weekly and monthly returns of both the major regional indices - the Czech PX-50 and PX-D, Hungarian BUX and Polish WIG20 - and individual shares that constitute the indices. Moreover, consequences of the non-synchronous trading for autocorrelations are discussed. In conclusion, the Central European region must be considered as a heterogeneous market. While the Hungarian market generally complies with the hypothesis and behaves weakly efficient, significant linear dependences are typical for the Czech stock market. Some unsystematic departures from the random walk model persist in Poland and the efficiency market hypothesis can not be validated there. Any abnormally profitable investment strategy that exploits technical analysis should thus avoid Hungarian stocks and exploit short-term dependences on the Czech and, to a lesser extant, Polish stock market.",

We find that adverse selection risk is highest on IPO listing day, and gradually reduces over the subsequent weeks. We observe that the degree of IPO underpricing is negatively related to ex-post adverse selection risk in the IPO aftermarket, suggesting that information production induced through IPO underpricing is able to mitigate adverse selection problems in IPO aftermarket. We also find that the ex-post adverse selection risk is related to various IPO, firm and liquidity characteristics.",

            "abstract": "This paper uses an event study analysis to assess how stock prices in the Philippines have reacted to domestic monetary-policy changes using data at a daily frequency from 2017 to 2022. A major contribution of this paper is the construction of a monetary-policy surprise measure for the Philippines, as the difference between the actual change in the monetary policy rate and the change anticipated by professional forecasters. My results are consistent with the literature, suggesting that unanticipated monetary policy changes exert a significant influence on stock prices in the Philippines. Overall, I find that an unexpected increase of 25 basis points in the monetary policy rate increases stock prices by about 1.09% on average. These results are robust to the inclusion of additional control variables in the baseline regression model, such as the implementation of restrictions to economic activity to curb the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak or revisions to macroeconomic forecasts released concomitantly with the monetary-policy rate announcement.",

            "abstract": "Through an orthogonalized impulse-response analysis, I studied the relationship between the variance risk premium, market variance and stock correlations in the French stock market from September 2002 through September 2006, using high frequency data-based measures. Variance risk premium is estimated using realized variances and index options-implied variances and used as a state vector to proxy investors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 perceived uncertainty. I found that a shock to variance risk premium causes long lasting increases in the market variance pointing to the limitedness of investors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 information-processing capacity. At the same time, the shock generates consecutive increases in realized correlations between individual stocks and the market portfolio. I propose then a possible explanation for the asymmetric/counter-cyclic behavior of stock correlations.",

We use daily data on the stock market index to study long-lasting differences in returns across the days of the week, within months and around holidays. For the period 1988-2001, we find no evidence that daily returns are different between weekdays. However, we find a closed-market effect during 1988-1996. This effect disappears for the 1997-2001 period which coincides with the period from when the Portuguese market started to be internationally considered as a developed market.",

In our investigation we employ daily values of the main indexes from the Bucharest Stock Exchange for two periods of time. During the first period, from January 2005 to September 2008, the Romanian capital market was relatively quiet and it experienced an ascendant trend. In the second period, from September 2008 to March 2012, the global crisis induced significant turbulence on the financial markets. We analyze the opportunities of momentum and contrarian profits based on the reactions to positive and negative shocks of the indexes returns. We find that global crises induced significant changes on the investors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 behavior.",

            "abstract": "This paper seeks to uncover whether periodic changes to the constituents in the Top 40 index lead to price distortions during quarterly index rebalancing. The premise for this research follows from the notable increase in assets under management of index tracker funds both globally and locally, in recent years. A larger asset base tracking a given index would imply larger volumes of forced buying and selling by passive tracker funds when changes are made to the constituents underlying the index. This follows as the passive trackers are tracking error sensitive as opposed to being price sensitive, which should lead to predictable excesses in demand for stocks entering and supply of stocks exiting the index. The objective of this research is to uncover whether these dynamics result in price distortions in the local index, and in particular whether it can be profitably exploited by front-running anticipated changes. Our study indeed confirms the existence of a highly profitable index effect, conditional upon timing trading actions correctly and being able to accurately predict entrants and deletions ahead of the public announcement.",

The Fractal Market Hypothesis (FMH) is chosen as the instrument to investigate the issue. By testing this hypothesis, the sudden price fluctuations in Bitcoin returns were tried to be determined. Daily closing price of Bitcoin between 04/2013-01/2019 were obtained from coinmarketcap. The fractal nature of Bitcoin market is tested with R/S, DFA, Periodogram and GPH models. The Hurst exponents show that FMH is valid in the Bitcoin market. Additionally, the effect of financial bubble formation and structural breaks on fractality is investigated through the ARFIMA-FIGARCH and ARFIMA-HYGARCH models. We observe that financial bubbles and regime changes increase the fractal structure (long memory) in the Bitcoin market.",

A Markov Switching Model (MSM) was employed as the analytical technique. The results show that the DOW effect appears in one regime and disappears in another, in all markets, as rooted in the AMH. Lastly, all markets, except the Johannesburg Stock Exchange have a higher tendency to be in a bearish state than a bullish one. Our findings show that active investment management may yield profits for investors investing in most African markets during bearish conditions.",

With a sample of seven stock market indices, the event study methodology is applied to examine the influence of the conflict between two countries on European ground over stock indices of emerging markets in South Eastern Europe. Results indicate that beginning of the conflict in late February brought a very strong significant price correction and stock markets in the examined countries became maximum oscillatory and subjected to light and rapid changes on a daily level. The findings contribute to the research on economic impact of the armed conflict by providing empirical evidence that conflict between two European (Non-European Union members) countries has spill-over effects on stock markets on other European (European Union members and Non-European Union members) countries. The findings have important implications for portfolio diversification and thus can serve in the asset allocation decision of investment managers.",
