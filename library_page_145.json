            "abstract": "We analyze the effects of Algorithmic News Trading (ANT) in the foreign exchange market around the time that the Bank of Japan makes public announcements of its policy decisions. To observe the activity level of ANT, we propose a novel measure based on a web access record to a central bank's webpage. We find that our proposed measure appropriately captures the activity level of ANT. Employing an event study analysis and a VAR analysis, we find that ANT increases market volatility immediately after the monetary policy announcements, and that ANT activity indirectly decreases market liquidity through increasing volatility. In addition, we suggest that ANT trades based on changes in texts on the monetary policy announcements.",

For this purpose, intraday data on the U.S. and euro-area bond and stock markets are used. A strong upsurge in intraday volatility at the time of the release of the monetary policy decisions by the two central banks is found, which is more pronounced for the U.S. financial markets following Federal Reserve monetary policy decisions. Part of the increase in intraday volatility in the two economies surrounding monetary policy decisions can be explained by both news of the level of monetary policy and revisions in the expected future monetary policy path. The observed strong discrepancy between asset-price reactions in the United States and in the euro area following monetary policy decisions still remains a puzzle, although some tentative explanations are provided in the paper.",

We apply a panel framework using daily data, and find that emerging-market asset prices respond most to statements by Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke, and much less to other Federal Reserve officials. We group emerging markets into those with \u00e2\u0080\u009crobust\u00e2\u0080\u009d fundamentals (current account surpluses, high international reserves, and low external debt) and those with \u00e2\u0080\u009cfragile\u00e2\u0080\u009d fundamentals and, intriguingly, find that the exchange rates of the robust group (and, to a lesser extent, equity prices and CDS spreads) were more adversely affected by tapering news than the fragile group. The cumulative effects of tapering announcements after a month, however, appear to be quite similar for both robust and fragile emerging markets. We also show that more financially developed economies are more affected by tapering news, and a plausible interpretation is that more financially developed economies are more exposed, at least in the short term, to external news announcements.",

We employ Multivariate Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedastic-Dynamic Conditional Correlation (M-GARCH-DCC) and Continuous Wavelet Transforms (CWT) for this study. We find that the COVID-19 crisis enhanced the spillover effect among the Islamic gold-backed cryptocurrencies and Islamic equities.

Following Fama and French factor approach, we sorted six portfolios by size and book to market. The sorted portfolios were constituted to represent stocks from each and every sector of KSE. Using Daily returns from January 2003 to December 2007, the excess returns for each portfolio were regressed on market, size and value factors. Our findings, in general, supported the notion of the three factor model. The three factor model was able to explain the variations in returns for most of the portfolios and the results remain robust when the sample was reduced to control for the size effect. Our findings are consistent with most of the studies that suggested the validity of the three factor model in emerging markets. These results warrant for the inclusion of size and value factors for valuation, capital budgeting and project appraisals, thus, having substantial implications for fund managers, analysts and investors.",

I document the informed trading is in the same direction of the realized returns in the 24-hour window before FOMC announcements, coinciding with the pre-FOMC uncertainty reduction. I integrate Kyle's (1985) model into a standard consumption-based asset pricing framework where the market makers are compensated for the risk of assets' fundamentals. Observing aggregate order flow, they update the belief about the marginal utility-weighted asset value, which resolves uncertainty gradually and results in an upward drift in market prices before announcements.

I argue that this evidence supports the hypothesis that the size effect is a consequence of market frictions and not a risk factor priced in equilibrium. High discount rates lower stock valuations and increase the overall book-to-market ratios in the market. They are also associated with the low risk bearing capacity, limited risk sharing and high uncertainty that increase market frictions. Ranking the years in book-to-market quantiles, as a proxy for discount rates, reveals that the size premium is usually statistically significant exclusively in the top book-to-market quantile. This evidence is robust to changes in the number of quantiles; in the US in different sub periods, and in the UK; considering both the Fama/French SMB factor or the individual size portfolios; and also controlling for market risk.",

            "abstract": "Objective - Previous research by this author has stated that the market overreaction phenomenon occurs in the Indonesian capital market and the CAPM (Capital Asset Pricing Model) is able to explain portfolio returns. However, CAPM is still debated along with the emergence of the other asset pricing models, such as the multifactor model proposed by Fama and French. The aim of this research is to test the ability of that model to explain the returns of portfolios formed under market overreaction conditions. Methodology/Technique - The data used in this study is the same as that of the previous research, which includes winner and loser portfolio data formed in market overreaction conditions, particularly on the Indonesian Stock Exchange, between July 2005 and December 2015. The multifactor models used include a three-factor model consisting of the factors of market, firm size, firm value, and a five-factor model with the added factors of profitability and investment. To obtain more accurate results, GARCH econometric models were also used in addition to standard test models for obtaining unbiased results. Findings - This research concludes that market factors (Rm-Rf), firm size (SMB), and firm value (HML), are able to explain the winner and loser portfolio returns well. However, when the factors of profitability (RMW) and investment (CMA) are added into the three-factor model, the RMW and CMA explained the returns negatively and inconsistently when the GARCH model is implemented. Novelty \u00c3\u00af\u00c2\u00bf\u00c2\u00bd These results imply that the three-factor model is more accurate than the five-factor model, contrary to the previous findings of Fama and French.",
