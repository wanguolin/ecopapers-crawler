            "abstract": "A Parent company occasionally spins off a wholly owned subsidiary or division, if it helps improve operational efficiency, reduce information asymmetry, reduce tax liability, and improve corporate governance. Therefore, it is suggested that corporate spin-offs create shareholders' value. It is also suggested that spin-off decisions may result in redistribution of wealth from debt holders to shareholders, because a part of the total assets of parent company are transferred to a newly incorporated independent company that replaces the wholly owned subsidiary or division. This study examines the value effect of 25 such corporate spin-off events that occurred in Singapore. Results show that parent shareholders gain about 15.73 percent value after spin-offs. Of which, 6.62 percent gain occurs in spin-off stocks while the remaining 9.11 percent occurs in parent stocks. The finding is consistent with the argument that corporate spin-offs have economic benefits to help increase shareholders' value. It is also found that total spin-off value gain is significantly correlated with the debt asset ratio of parent firms, which sheds light on the possibility of wealth redistribution from the bondholders to shareholders due to change in parent capital structure after spin-off.",

            "abstract": "This paper uses an event study methodology to examine the stock price behavior surrounding announcements of stock repurchases made by Taiwan firms from 2000 to 2008. Our analysis shows that stock prices go up in response to stock repurchase announcements. We also find the announcement effects between various industries to be significantly different; the announcement effect is greatest in the financial industry and least in the electronics industry. Finally, firms which fully executed stock repurchases were confirmed to have experienced a relatively large stock price decline in the pre-announcement period compared with those which executed less than 10% stock repurchases; however, there is no significant difference in their announcement effects.",

The study investigates 27 companies listed in the middle capitalization and large capitalization stocks of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. The study measured earnings by 1) earnings per share percentage change, 2) dividend per share percentage change and 3) cash flow per share percentage change. These variables were investigated over a period of 6 years, 3 years pre- and 3 years post-announcement of share repurchase. The data was analyzed and tested using the T-test and the Wilcoxon parametric paired test.",

            "abstract": "Under globalization and international market integration, exploring seasonality in global equity markets is imperative for portfolio managers and individual investors to timely reconstruct their portfolios and for firms to optimally schedule the issue of either new shares or IPOs. Prior research supports the presence of the January effect, particularly in the US stock market. However, in the context of international stock markets, the evidence is less compelling and often contradictory. This paper provides a fresh look at monthly seasonality in 34 international equity markets over the period from January 1988 to December 2010. Unlike prior findings, we do not find a significant January effect except perhaps for 3 markets. Instead, we find significantly larger and positive anomalies across the vast majority of these markets for December and April. The results further suggest the presence of significant negative anomalies for June, August, and September across most global markets in the sample.",

It analyzes cash, stock, and simultaneous cash and stock dividend announcements of 79 companies listed on the Karachi Stock Exchange from July 2004 to June 2007. Abnormal returns from the market model are evaluated for statistical significance using the t-test and Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test. The findings suggest negligible abnormal returns for cash dividend announcements. However, the average abnormal and cumulative average abnormal returns for stock and simultaneous cash and stock dividend announcements are mostly positive and statistically significant.",

            "abstract": "This study explores the connectedness between major oil-producing and consuming countries' stock markets (United States, China, Russia, India) and different oil shocks categorized as demand, supply, and risk shocks, following Ready's (2018) framework. Employing a quantile-based connectedness approach and quantile cross-spectral dependence, our analysis spans from July 02, 2007 to May 31, 2023, encompassing diverse market conditions and events. These methodologies help identify interdependence patterns in extreme market scenarios at different time intervals. Key findings show variations in how these stock markets respond to oil shocks, depending on market conditions and quantiles. Demand-related shocks have the most significant spillover effects on the United States, Russia, and India, while risk-related shocks dominate as transmitters of shocks to the United States, China, and India in median quantiles. Market interconnectedness strengthens during extreme market conditions, reflecting historical events. Additionally, bearish markets offer diversification opportunities between these countries and crude oil. This study emphasizes the need for tailored investment strategies, monitoring global oil demand trends, dynamic portfolio management, crude oil inclusion in portfolios, and proactive responses to market players and geopolitical events. These insights benefit investors and policymakers seeking to optimize strategies in the interconnected global financial landscape.",

            "abstract": "Oil price instabilities have direct and heterogeneous implications for stock sector markets as a result of portfolio risk management and fund allocations. Previous studies have shown that the oil-stock market nexus is asymmetric and strongly vulnerable to international events. Using daily data of ten Chinese stock sector indices and the West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures over the period from July 2, 2007, to September 3, 2021, we examine the quantile return spillovers and interconnectedness between these markets using the approach of Ando et al. (2022), showing that return spillovers between the markets under investigation are more pronounced under bearish market conditions than during bullish ones. Major financial, political, energy, and COVID-19 pandemic events have magnified spillovers. Irrespective of the state of the market, oil is always a net receiver of return spillovers. Moreover, for all sectors other than materials, the sector that acts as a net receiver during bearish market conditions becomes a net contributor during bullish market conditions, and vice versa. During the COVID-19 period, the hedging technique was the most cost-effective. In the event of a global pandemic, the IT, financial, telecommunication, and energy sectors can benefit from oil's higher hedging effectiveness. Oil was a cheaper hedging asset during the pandemic, and it offered the highest hedging effectiveness to utilities before the outbreak and to the financial sector during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

            "abstract": "We analyze the serial correlation of the weekly returns of the MIB and MIB30 indexes over the period 1985-1997 from two different perspectives. First, we explore whether the observed serial dependence of returns is consistent with the random walk model. This has been done by testing two specifications of the model. We find that the first specification, given by the hypothesis of i.i.d. returns, is clearly rejected by the data, while the statistical evidence against the second specification, given by the more general hypothesis of uncorrelated or linearly independent returns, is much weaker, especially for the MIB30 returns. In the second part of the paper we study the possibility that a serially correlated process implied by a specific model of time-variation in expected returns could generate a degree of linear dependence similar to that observed in actual returns. We find that a combination of fast mean reversion in expected returns and small pricing errors in realized returns produces an autocorrelation pattern similar to that actually observed.",

It shows that market participants have opportunities to predict future price and earn abnormal returns from the Nepalese stock market.

It indicates that technical analysis may not be fruitful to earn excess returns in overall and development banking sectors.",

Turnover in stocks headquartered in an outage area with 0.5% of U.S. electrical customers drops by 3\u00e2\u0080\u00937% on the first full day of the outage, and bid\u00e2\u0080\u0093ask spreads narrow by 2.5%. Firm-specific price volatility is 2.3% lower on blackout dates. This effect is larger for smaller, lesser-known stocks and in higher income areas. Consistent with a valuation discount and higher expected returns for stocks with more informed traders, firms with a one-standard-deviation higher local trading propensity have market-to-book values that are 5% lower, Tobin's Q that is 6% lower, annualized four-factor alphas that are 1.2% higher, and average spreads that are 6.5% higher. Together, the evidence suggests that informed investors contribute disproportionately to both liquidity and price discovery, and that these contributions are reflected in valuations and expected returns.",
