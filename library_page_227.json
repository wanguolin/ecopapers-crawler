            "abstract": "Abstract This paper investigates whether short-term momentum and long-term reversal may emerge from the wealth reallocation process taking place in speculative markets. We assume that there are two classes of investors who trade long-lived assets by holding constantly rebalanced portfolios based on their beliefs. Provided beliefs, and thus portfolios, are sufficiently diversified, all investors survive in the long-run and, due to waves of mispricing, the resulting equilibrium returns exhibit long-term reversal. If, moreover, asset dividends are positively correlated, investors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 profitable trades become positively correlated too, thus generating short-term momentum in equilibrium returns. We use the model to replicate the performance of the Winners and Losers portfolios highlighted by the empirical literature and to provide insights on how to improve upon them. Finally, we show that dividend positive autocorrelation is positively related to momentum and negatively related to reversal while diversity of beliefs is positively related to both momentum and reversal.",

            "abstract": "Abstract The literature is rich with examples of price clustering in financial markets. This study focuses on the relation between mutual fund ownership (both active and passive) and stock price clustering. To the extent that mutual funds are sophisticated investors, we posit that their trades are associated with lower levels of price clustering. We find support for this hypothesis as total, active, and passive mutual fund ownership are negatively related to the degree of price clustering. Surprisingly, price clustering\u00e2\u0080\u0099s association to passive (e.g. index) mutual fund ownership is an order of magnitude greater than to active ownership.",

            "abstract": "We develop a novel financial market model in which the stock markets of two countries are linked via and with the foreign exchange market. To be precise, there are domestic and foreign speculators in each of the two stock markets which rely either on linear technical or linear fundamental trading strategies to determine their orders. Since foreign stock market speculators require foreign currency to conduct their trades, all three markets are connected. Our setup entails a natural nonlinearity which may cause persistent endogenous price dynamics. Moreover, we analytically show that market interactions can destabilize the model's fundamental steady state.",

            "abstract": "This paper introduces an information-based reinforcement learning to exploit information channels to traders\u00e2\u0080\u0099 trading behavior in an equilibrium limit order market. Anticipating that informed traders are more likely to submit market buy (sell) orders when asset is significantly under (over) valued, uninformed traders tend to chase market buy (sell) orders of the informed to buy (sell). To gain from the order chasing of the uninformed, informed traders strategically submit more market buy (sell) and limit sell (buy) orders. This amplifies the order chasing behaviour of the uninformed, generating predictable trading behaviours that can improve information efficiency but reduce market liquidity. Order book information and learning can have opposite effects on order choices and endogenous liquidity provision for the informed and uninformed. Furthermore, more informed trading is beneficial, but fast trading can be harmful for market quality.",

            "abstract": "This study investigates the efficiency of wine market and explores the predictability in wine returns. Daily returns on a portfolio of wines denominated in the original currency of trade for the period exhibit significant positive serial correlation that persists further when wine returns are sampled at weekly and monthly frequencies. Abnormal excess returns on wine are earned by various trading strategies designed to exploit trending behavior in asset prices before trading fees. After accounting for market frictions such as transaction costs, the abnormal profitability from wine trading evaporates. Claims of inefficiency and return predictability in a market sensitive to market frictions can be exaggerated when the latter are ignored.",

Utilizing a Quantile Vector Autoregression (QVAR) methodology, we analyze the relationships among these variables, emphasizing the dynamics between cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and DeFi assets. Our analysis explores the presence of spillover effects leading up to and during these crises. Notably, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Binance Coin (BNB), Ethereum, and Bitcoin acted as net transmitters, whereas DeFi and NFT-related cryptocurrencies served as vulnerable net receivers. Conversely, in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, LINK, FTX, and Theta transitioned from transmitters to net receivers. In the Terra Luna crash, LINK remained a primary net receiver. During the FTX crash, FTX, Binance Coin (BNB), Maker (MKR), LINK, and Synthetix (SNX) consistently operated as major net receivers. These findings offer valuable insights for stakeholders, including investors, portfolio managers, and policymakers, shedding light on the evolving dynamics and interconnectedness of digital assets in crisis settings. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for informed risk management and the development of effective investment strategies.",

A survey of investors reveals that the last month realized returns are positively correlated with next month perceived returns and that they are negatively correlated with perceived risk. Neither expected return nor perceived risk captures the entire effect. Thus, in the human mind the \u00e2\u0080\u009cperceived Sharpe ratio\u00e2\u0080\u009d is positively correlated with short-term past returns. The effect does not depend on gender, education, income, and portfolio value, but it is more profound among older investors.",

Studying a 13-year long (1998\u00e2\u0080\u00932010) price series of spot and futures prices at Nord Pool and employing regression models with GARCH residuals, we show that the impact of the water reservoir level on the risk premium is positive, which is to be expected, but contradicts the results of Botterud et al.

Using a empirical measure of brand capital stock constructed from advertising expenditures accounting data, we show that: (i) firms with low brand capital investment rates have higher average stock returns than firms with high brand capital investment rates, a difference of 5.2% per annum; (ii) more brand capital intensive firms have higher average stock returns than less brand capital intensive firms, a difference of 5.1% per annum; and (iii) investment in both brand capital and physical capital is volatile and procyclical. A neoclassical investment-based model in which brand capital is a factor of production subject to adjustment costs matches the data well. The model also provides a novel explanation for the empirical links between advertising expenditures and stock returns around seasoned equity offerings (SEO) documented in previous studies.
