            "abstract": "Using badla financing as a measure of leverage we examine both temporal and contemporaneous links among badla financing, stock returns and market volatility. We find that the market volatility is significantly and positively related to the change in badla financing and to past market returns. We also observe a significantly positive temporal causation between prior market returns and both badla financing as well as stock price volatility.",

            "abstract": "This article investigates the news coverage of the PSI20 index\u00e2\u0080\u0099s companies, when they registered extreme abnormal returns during a nine years\u00e2\u0080\u0099 period. It looks for evidence on whether listed companies manage information before or after the occurrence of extreme returns. We found divergences between the news coverage performed in situations of abnormal positive returns and in opposite situations, which seem to result from actions promoted by these companies deliberately. In particular, calls to the first page of the newspapers are more prevalent for positive events, which indicates that companies, in advance, promote information by communicating it to the media. In addition, before the event, companies are proportionally more cited as a source of the news for positive events. This indicates that companies seek to capitalize the positive impact of the favourable situation they subsequently disclose to the market. In the period after the occurrence of extreme abnormal returns, companies are more often a source of the news for negative events, seeking to mitigate the impact of the relevant fact. Concerning the provision of interviews and the publication of advertisements, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no evidence that the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s behaviour is distinct depending on the sign of the verified abnormal return.",

This study presents direct evidence contrasting a dark venue that offers equal access to all market participants to other dark pools which have the ability to subjectively exclude order flow. Using the period leading up to surprise corporate earnings news, I document robust evidence of informed trading taking place in the fair access dark venue. I do not find such evidence in other dark venues.",

            "abstract": "This paper analyzes the impact of economic news, that is, the difference between economic announcements and what was anticipated, on financial markets. The three contributions of this paper are, first, the market expectation is derived from economic derivative prices that allow a full distribution for the market expectation to be derived. Economic derivatives data better predict financial market movements and also allow for testing whether there is information in the high moments of the distribution. Second, high frequency financial data allows us to test for the optimal window and discover how long it takes financial markets to digest and react to news. Finally, by using a U.S. and a European economic announcement and a wide range of financial markets, this paper compares announcements to show which are important for which markets. I find that high frequency financial data leads to a much bigger and more significant news announcement effect over previous studies that used end-of day data. Further, financial markets react very quickly to news. Unlike other studies that have assumed a 25-30 minute window, I have demonstrated that the announcement window is often as little as just one minute. Using the richness of the economic derivatives-based expectations data I determine when higher moments of the expectations distribution are useful in determining the announcement effect. I also show in which markets, and for which announcements, good news and bad news have asymmetric effects; and, in which markets are most responsive to which announcements. Finally, I have highlighted some of the interesting results that traders or risk managers might want to delve into in more detail.",

Unlike previous research we have investigated the five most usual types of recommendations: buy, outperform, hold, underperform and sell. The methodology we propose is also different from previous studies. From our results we conclude that positive (negative) abnormal returns are associated to positive (negative and neutral) recommendations, the day of publication of the recommendation and the day before, but not the day after publication. We also document an asymmetry in the effect of recommendation on the stock trading volume, following the sign of the recommendation.",

            "title": "Assessment of investment returns through the prism of investment strategies: comparison of performance of the most successful investors and the Slovenian funds",
            "abstract": "In this paper, the authors analyze the investment philosophies and strategies of three financial mogul companies to find out what strategies they apply, yielding high returns. They also analyze their performance compared to Slovenian mutual funds and the broader stock market. The authors focus on some key research hypotheses. First, they are interested in assessing and monitoring the company's future intrinsic value, which refers to a fundamental, objective value contained in a financial asset. If the market price is below this value, this financial asset may be a good buy, or if it is above, it may be a good sale. While studying the investment strategies, they check if such an assessment enables above-average investment returns. Second, the authors state that the fund's profitability and risk reflect the chosen investment strategy. Investors generally expect higher returns from riskier investments. Risk tolerance is one of the critical factors determining the return on investment. Typically, higher-risk investments have the potential for higher returns, but they also come with a greater risk of loss. The authors compare and test how the risk is embedded in the investment strategies of three renowned financial investors and Slovenia mutual funds. Third, the authors hypothesised that time and patience are among the most critical factors in investing. The authors' fourth research hypothesis relates to the question if the stock market always accurately reflect the value of individual companies. Many researchers today argue that some market participants behave irrationally, what leads to market inefficiency. They suggest that the financial market can never be perfectly efficient. In the theoretical part of the paper, the authors begin with a brief literature overview underlying how different factors affect investment returns, especially focusing on the indicator ROI. Further, they shortly represent the investment strategies of Buffett, Ackman, and Palihapitiya. In the empirical part of the paper, they perform some financial calculations \u00e2\u0080\u0094 annual return, average annual return, annual standard deviation, Sharpe ratio, and then proceed with a Monte Carlo simulation and a CAPM model. The author's findings show that a deep understanding and accurate assessment of a company's intrinsic value leads to above-average returns. The risk and return of a fund are tied to the strategy chosen, with those willing to accept a higher risk often achieving higher returns. They underline the importance of time and patience in investing and observe that the stock market does not always reflect the exact value of an individual company accurately, which emphasizes the importance of critical judgement and not blindly following market trends.",

The first is to examine the profitability of applying investment strategies based on \u00e2\u0080\u009cbuy\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009csell\u00e2\u0080\u009d recommendations issued by stock market analysts. The second objective is to validate that analysts who issue a recommendation may not be impartial (not supporting any of the sides involved in an argument) because the largest group of recommendations issued is \u00e2\u0080\u009cbuy\u00e2\u0080\u009d recommendations. Design/methodology/approach \u00e2\u0080\u0093 This study was conducted based on all the \u00e2\u0080\u009cbuy\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009csell\u00e2\u0080\u009d recommendations issued during the period between January 1, 2004 and December 31, 2016 for companies listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange, using data from www.bankier.pl. The annual forecast rates of return were determined for all the recommendations included in the survey. The expected rates of return were determined for each recommendation based on the information collated from the Bloomberg database. The regression analysis enabled the exploration of the relationship between the actual rates of return and the rates of return predicted in recommendations. Findings \u00e2\u0080\u0093 It was determined that investing on the basis of the information included in \u00e2\u0080\u009csell\u00e2\u0080\u009d recommendations might make it possible to avoid unprofitable investments. At the same time, the study shows that an investment strategy compliant with \u00e2\u0080\u009cbuy\u00e2\u0080\u009d recommendations does not let the investor achieve the expected rates of return on an investment in the capital market in the long term. Research implications/limitations \u00e2\u0080\u0093 The conducted research could be an important source of information for stock market investors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 decision-making regarding investments. Originality/value/contribution \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Despite the topic of recommendation effectiveness being very important from the perspective of capital market theory and practice, it is still unclear whether investing based on information provided in stock market recommendations can be a profitable strategy in the long run.

In this study, I test the profitability of these rules i) on more recent DJIA data to see if their profitability survives out-of-sample and is robust to publicity and presence of an index futures market, ii) on the Istanbul Stock Exchange (ISE), which enables useful comparisons. Results suggest that the profitability of the technical rules tested by BLL have recently disappeared on DJIA, and that these rules have performed better on the ISE-100 index. I notice one exception which BLL overlooked: The 22-day simple moving average rule, which has been widely used by short-term traders, still performs positively on DJIA and produces significantly positive profits on the ISE-100 index, even after transaction costs. I use results on these samples with contrasting characteristics to develop hypotheses on the determinants of the profitability of these simple technical trading rules.",

            "abstract": "Although stock splits seem to be a purely cosmetic event, there exists ample empirical evidence from the United States that stock splits are associated with abnormal returns on both the announcement and the execution day, and additionally with an increase in variance following the ex-day. This paper investigates the market reaction to stock splits using a set of German firms. Consistent with the U.S. findings, similar effects are observed for the sample of German stock splits. Institutional differences between Germany and the U.S. allow to disentangle the three main hypotheses on the announcement effect - signalling, liquidity, and neglected firm hypothesis - to gain further insights into their relative explanation power. This paper argues that legal restrictions strongly limit the ability of German companies to use a stock split for signaling. Consistently, abnormal returns around the announcement day are much lower in Germany than in the U.S. Although a significant increase in liquidity can be found after the split crosssectional tests do not lend any support to the hypothesis that price changes are positively related to liquidity changes. This is in contrast to the results of Muscarella/Vetsuypens (1996) and Amihud/Mendelson/Lauterbach (1997). The paper shows that the announcement effect to German stock splits is best explained by a neglected firm effect. On the methodological side the effect of thin trading on event study results is examined. Using tradeto-trade returns increases the significance of abnormal returns but the difference between alternative return measurement methods is relatively small in short event periods. Thus, the observed market reaction cannot be attributed to measurement problems caused by thin trading.",
