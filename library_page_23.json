            "title": "Stock Price Patterns around the Trades of Corporate Insiders on the London Stock Exchange",
            "abstract": "This paper examines the patterns of security returns around the trades of corporate insiders in the shares of their own company. We find patterns in abnormal returns in the days around a director's trade that are consistent with directors engaging in short-term market timing: they sell (buy) after an increase (decline) in prices, and their trades are followed by a partial price reversal. This provides strong evidence that directors trade to exploit patterns in share prices. We also find positive gross, but not net, abnormal returns to imitating some of the trades of directors once transactions costs implicit in the bid-ask spread are taken into account. We also report that some types of trades have superior predictive content over future returns. In particular, we find that medium-sized trades are more informative for short-term returns than large ones, consistent with Barclay and Warner's (1993) \"stealth trading\" hypothesis",

            "title": "Rentabilidad a Corto Plazo de los Insiders en los Mercados Espa\u00c2\u00a4ol y Brit nico",
            "abstract": "El estudio de las rentabilidades de las operaciones de los insiders corporativos es un tema vigente de investigaci\u00c2\u00a2n por sus importantes implicaciones tanto cient\u00c2\u00a1ficas (sobre la eficiencia del mercado) como pol\u00c2\u00a1ticas (efectividad de la regulaci\u00c2\u00a2n del insider trading). El presente trabajo trata de analizar el comportamiento de los insiders en dos mercados de valores situados en el mismo entorno geogr fico, pero caracterizados por dos marcos legales diferentes, como son Espa\u00c2\u00a4a y Reino Unido. A trav\u00e2\u0080\u009as de un estudio de eventos, analizamos de forma simult nea las operaciones de inversi\u00c2\u00a2n individual de directivos empresariales en ambos mercados y analizamos sus rentabilidades en el corto plazo. Usando el estad\u00c2\u00a1stico estandarizado documentado en Dodd y Warner (1983), encontramos que los insiders de ambos pa\u00c2\u00a1ses obtienen rentabilidades superiores tanto en ventas como en compras, siendo m s significativas las compras, resultado que es consistente con la mayor parte de la literatura. Por \u00c2\u00a3ltimo, se detecta una reacci\u00c2\u00a2n mucho mayor en el mercado brit nico en las fechas inmediatamente posteriores a las operaciones de compra de los insiders, lo cual podr\u00c2\u00a1a apoyar las tesis de Manne (1966) sobre la mayor rapidez en la incorporaci\u00c2\u00a2n de la informaci\u00c2\u00a2n a los precios a trav\u00e2\u0080\u009as de las operaciones de insiders. The investigation of the returns associated to corporate insiders transactions is an outstanding topic nowadays due to its implications on both academia research (due to its influence on market efficiency) and political issues (lack of effectiveness of insider trading regulation). The current paper attempts to analyse insiders? behaviour in two European stock markets, located in the same geographical area but characterised by different legal environments, such as UK and Spain. By using the event studies methodology, we simultaneously study insider trading profitability in both markets in the short term. By applying Dodd and Warner?s (1983) standardised test, we detect that insiders in both countries obtained abnormal returns in both their sales and purchases, although purchases seem to have a bigger information content, supporting wide previous literature. Finally, we may highlight that the higher market reaction detected in the Uk market for purchases in the post-event period seems to corroborate Manne\u00c3\u00afs (1966) thesis on the positive effects of insider trading which enables stock prices to rapidly impound insiders? information.",

            "abstract": "The Security and Exchange Commission revoked the uptick rule in July 2007. The revocation of the uptick rule provides us with a unique setting to investigate the impact of short-sale constraints on various short-selling strategies in a controlled environment. Comparing short-selling behaviors for uptick-rule restricted and unrestricted stocks during the pre- and post-revocation periods, we find that contrarian short selling and voluntary-liquidity short selling are more profound in uptick-rule-restricted stocks than in unrestricted stock and that market trend chasing short selling is less profound in uptick-rule-restricted stocks than in unrestricted stocks. Our results also show that the uptick rule has no impact on risk-bearing short-selling strategies.",

In leverage-adjusted, hedged returns, the alpha due to liquidity risk ranges from 8.5 to 14.6 basis points per month. In hedged returns unadjusted for leverage, the alpha ranges from 165.9 to 185.1 basis points per month. Compared with the option bid-ask spread, the premium is small in magnitude. In contrast to the findings for stocks and bonds, the liquidity risk premium uncovered in option returns is negative. We explain the negative premium by noting that option end-users write options in net and they might care more about liquidity risk than market makers.",

            "abstract": "We find that the difference between implied and realized variation, or the variance risk premium, is able to explain more than fifteen percent of the ex-post time series variation in quarterly excess returns on the market portfolio over the 1990 to 2005 sample period, with high (low) premia predicting high (low) future returns. The magnitude of the return predictability of the variance risk premium easily dominates that afforded by standard predictor variables like the P/E ratio, the dividend yield, the default spread, and the consumption-wealth ratio (CAY). Moreover, combining the variance risk premium with the P/E ratio results in an R2 for the quarterly returns of more than twenty-five percent. The results depend crucially on the use of \u00e2\u0080\u009cmodel-free\u00e2\u0080\u009d, as opposed to standard Black-Scholes, implied variances, and realized variances constructed from high-frequency intraday, as opposed to daily, data. Our findings suggest that temporal variation in both risk-aversion and volatility-risk play an important role in determining stock market returns.",

            "abstract": "This paper contributes to the behavioural finance literature that examines the asset pricing impact of mood altering events such as sports results, sunshine levels, daylight hours, public holidays, temperature etc. Specifically, we investigate whether variations in investor mood arising from wins and losses in major sporting events have an impact on stock market returns. We examine the case of Ireland. Ireland is an interesting case because its people are passionate about sport, the domestic population is relatively homogenous (rather than divided) in terms of support for Irish competitors in international competition and domestic investors comprise a large proportion of owners of Irish stocks\u00e2\u0080\u0094all factors which suggest that if a mood effect exists it should show up in this case. Generally, we do not find a strong link between sport results and stock market returns. Initial results do suggest that in events of particularly high importance, such as the knock-out stages of major competitions, losses are associated with negative returns. However, on controlling for indirect economic effects of sporting wins and losses such as on tourism and travel we find the mood effect is no longer significant.",

            "abstract": "According to the weak-form of the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH), investors should not be able to outperform the market consistently by looking at charts of past share prices or by devising trading rules based on historic share returns. This paper investigates the extent to which the equity prices of firms listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) are consistent with this hypothesis. In particular, the paper investigates the weak-form efficiency of the NSE using weekly returns for the 69 most actively traded shares over the period 1995-2005. The paper tests the weak-form of the EMH using a battery of tests including tests of autocorrelations and technical trading strategies. Overall, the analysis indicates that the Nigerian market may be weak-form efficient for ordinary investors who operate in a costly trading environment",

For the stock markets from East Europe the results are in line with the symmetric volatility, i.e. volatility is similar affected by both positive and negative returns with the same magnitude. For the stock markets from Central Europe the results are consistent with the leverage hypothesis of the asymmetric volatility, i.e. negative and positive returns with the same magnitude have different impact on volatility. Furthermore the volatility is more sensitive to its lagged values in the market place than it is to new information. These results reinforce the diversification principle that has to be considered in portfolio and risk management process.",
