            "title": "Asset Pricing in the Information Age: Employee Expectations and Stock Returns",
            "abstract": "Firms with more positive employee expectations tend to earn higher future returns, delivering annualized abnormal returns ranging from 8% to 11%. Employees\u00e2\u0080\u0099 forward-looking expectations are a stronger return predictor than employee satisfaction, which is backward-looking. Employee expectations can predict returns because they reflect information about firms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 fundamentals that has not yet been reflected in traditional data sources, such as earnings reports. Hedge funds actively trade on this information, consistent with a decay in forecasting power over longer holding horizons. Overall, this paper highlights the importance of labor in asset pricing, specifically from the perspective of employee expectations. (JEL G12, G14)",

            "abstract": "Bayesian learning provides the core concept of processing noisy information. In standard Bayesian frameworks, assessing the price impact of information requires perfect knowledge of news\u00e2\u0080\u0099 precision. In practice, however, precision is rarely disclosed. Therefore, we extend standard Bayesian learning, suggesting traders infer news\u00e2\u0080\u0099 precision from magnitudes of surprises and from external sources. We show that interactions of the different precision signals may result in highly nonlinear price responses. Empirical tests based on intra-day T-bond futures price reactions to employment releases confirm the model\u00e2\u0080\u0099s predictions and show that the effects are statistically and economically significant.",

            "abstract": "An important claim of Bayesian learning and a standard assumption in price discovery models is that the strength of the price impact of unanticipated information depends on the precision of the news. In this paper, we test for this assumption by analyzing intra-day price responses of CBOT T-bond futures to U.S. employment announcements. By employing additional detail information besides the widely used headline figures, we extract release-specific precision measures which allow to test for the claim of Bayesian updating. We find that the price impact of more precise information is significantly stronger. The results remain stable even after controlling for an asymmetric price response to 'good' and 'bad' news.",

            "abstract": "This paper provides evidence that managers adjust firm advertising, in part, to attract investor attention and influence short-term stock returns. First, I show that increased advertising spending is associated with a contemporaneous rise in retail buying and abnormal stock returns, and is followed by lower future returns. Next, I document a significant increase in advertising spending prior to insider sales, and a significant decrease in the subsequent year. Additional analyses suggest that the inverted-V-shaped pattern in advertising spending around insider sales is most consistent with managers' opportunistically adjusting firm advertising to exploit the temporary return effect to their own benefit.",

Using behavioral finance the amount of loss trades is larger than 60%, however the individual gains are larger than the losses leading to an overall profit. Using this approach we show, that behavioral finance rules can be quantified and a trading outperformance is possible just using 24h spot rates and 3 day volatilities.",

            "abstract": "We examine some basic data on the evolution of aggregate short interest, both during the dot-com era, and at other times in history. Total short interest moves in a countercyclical fashion. For example, short interest in NASDAQ stocks actually declines as the NASDAQ index approaches its peak. Moreover, this decline does not seem to reflect a substitution away from outright short-selling and towards put options, as the ratio of put-to-call volume displays the same countercyclical tendency. The evidence suggests that: i) arbitrageurs are reluctant to bet against aggregate mispricings; and ii) short-selling does not play a particularly helpful role in stabilizing the overall stock market.",

Short-term momentum is as profitable and as persistent as conventional price momentum. It survives transaction costs and is strongest among the largest, most liquid, and most extensively covered stocks. Our results are difficult to reconcile with models imposing strict rationality but are suggestive of an explanation based on some traders underappreciating the information conveyed by prices.",

We argue this covariance is due to contagion based on re- turn decomposition evidence, cross-sectional heterogeneity in the extent of the e\u00c2\u00a4ect, and the magnitude of average abnormal returns to a cross-stock reversal trading strat- egy exploiting information in these connections.

The new factor model outperforms the Carhart four-factor model in pricing portfolios formed on earnings surprise, idiosyncratic volatility, financial distress, net stock issues, composite issuance, as well as on investment and return on equity. The new model performs similarly as the Carhart model in pricing portfolios formed on size and momentum, abnormal corporate investment, as well as on size and book-to-market, but underperforms in pricing the total accrual deciles. The new model's performance, combined with its clear economic intuition, suggests that it can be used as a new workhorse model for academic research and investment management practice.",

This allows us to differentiate between the consistent price reaction to surprising news and traders? uncertainty about the precise price impact of this information. Analyzing the US employment report, we find that headline information is almost instantaneously incorporated into T-bond futures prices. Nevertheless, large surprises create considerable uncertainty, in particular ?bad? news. In contrast, if surprises in related headlines cross-validate each other, less room for differences of opinion is left, and hence volatility is decreased.",
