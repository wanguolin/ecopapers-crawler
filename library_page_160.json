            "abstract": "This paper tests the weak-form efficient market hypothesis for Korean industry-sorted portfolios. Based on a panel variance ratio approach, we find significant mean reversion of stock returns over long horizons in the pre Asian currency crisis period but little evidence in the post-crisis period. Our empirical findings are consistent with the fact that Korea accelerated its integration with international financial market by implementing extensive capital liberalization since the crisis.",

            "abstract": "In this paper, we test the role of order flows in KRW/USD. We use transaction based high frequency data (electronic broker) happened in 2006. For robustness check, we extend our analysis by combining exchange rates (indicative quotes v.s. transaction rate), frequency (transaction based time v.s. 1 minute through 1 day), and order flows (sign v.s. signed volume). The results show that order flow is an important variable for explaining the KRW/USD regardless of frequency and of choice of quotes. Based on Hasbrouck's measure we find that 14-28% of permanent exchange rate variation is due to private information. The magnitude is smaller than that of international currency presenting, for example, in Payne (2003). The discrepancy arises both from currency choice and from too short data span in Payne (2003).",

            "abstract": "This study quantifies the dynamic interrelationship between the KOSPI index return and search query data derived from the Naver DataLab. The empirical estimation using a bivariate GARCH model reveals that negative contemporaneous correlations between the stock return and the search frequency prevail during the sample period. Meanwhile, the search frequency has a negative association with the one-week- ahead stock return but not vice versa. In addition to identifying dynamic correlations, the paper also aims to serve as a test bed in which the existence of profitable trading strategies based on big data is explored. Specifically, the strategy interpreting the heightened investor attention as a negative signal for future returns appears to have been superior to the benchmark strategy in terms of the expected utility over wealth. This paper also demonstrates that the big data-based option trading strategy might be able to beat the market under certain conditions. These results highlight the possibility of big data as a potential source-which has been left largely untapped-for establishing profitable trading strategies as well as developing insights on stock market dynamics.",

The intraday data of the first local ETF, VNMVN30 on HOSE \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Hochiminh stock market has been tracked and analyzed for one month. The findings reveal that the VNMVN30 ETF has a small deviation in price. This deviation is persistent with low change level between one-minute intervals. This outcome contributes to current literature of arbitrage opportunities in emerging markets. Furthermore, as a practical contribution, the investors in ETF investment will significantly benefit as this paper suggests a pattern of VNMVN30 ETF in a day and estimates transaction costs related to arbitrage strategies of E1 VFN30.",

            "abstract": "In the past, it was believed that investors may generate abnormal returns (AR) for trading stocks by employing technical trading rules. However, since the COVID-19 pandemic broke out, stock markets around the world seem to suffer a serious impact. Therefore, whether investors can beat the markets by applying technical trading rules during the period of COVID-19 pandemic becomes an important issue for market participants. The purpose of this study is to examine the profitability of trading stocks with the use of technical trading rules under the COVID-19 pandemic. By trading the constituent stocks of DJ 30 and NASDAQ 100, we find that almost all of the trading rules employed in this study fail to beat the market during the COVID-19 pandemic period, which is different from the results in 2019. The revealed findings of this study may shed light on that investors should adopt technical trading with care when stock markets are seriously affected by black swan events like COVID-19.",

It is well known in literature, and among practitioners, that 'Low Beta strategies' generate good performances exploiting alpha opportunities. In this paper, we focus on Beta parameters: we analyze this one and its components (Correlation and Standard Deviation) in order to better understand the drivers and contributions behind the 'Low Beta strategies', and eventually exploit them. We perform an extensive empirical analysis on the S&P500 and the relative sectors, covering more than 10 years. In addition, we follow Long/Short strategies in building portfolios based on Beta and their components where we compare results against the benchmark. We also introduce 'Walking Beta' approach in order to give a deep and innovative view on the market risk/reward relationship, illustrating different time frames and the evolution of risk parameters.",

Starting from a correlation rolling window approach, three different regressions techniques have been implemented; the simple Ordinary Least Squares regressions (OLS), the linear Quantile (LQR) regression and the Multiple regression model (MLR), all performed at different levels in terms of stocks (QoQ and YoY) and sectors (MoM, QoQ, YoY). The cross-sectional and time-series results support the effects of cash flow volatility on the stocks' performance and highlighted its sensitivity respect not only the different short-term and long-term horizons, but also in terms of sector' exposure.",

The article investigates the effect on the investor preferences change in temperature by using daily data. Unlike previous studies in the existing literature, negative and positive effects of change in temperature on investors are researched separately. As indicator parameter of behavior of investors, BIST100 price index and total trade volume are used. Thus, the effects of positive and negative shocks happened in temperature change, are examined both as return and trade volume. According to findings, investors react both positive and negative temperature change in same direction. In other word, positive temperature changes can be assumed as a factor increases the trade volume and positive returns in stock market. Similarly, negative temperature changes affect stock market in direction of decreasing trade volume and returns.",
