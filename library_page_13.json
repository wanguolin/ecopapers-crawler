            "abstract": "The paper is aimed to analyze and evaluate the dividend announcement impact on stock prices of companies listed on the NASDAQ OMX Baltic market during 2010-2015. The analysis was performed using the market model event study analysis and calculating AARs based on 3 strategies, which assume that investors buy shares 30 days prior to the dividend announcement and sell them either 1, 3 or 7 days after the dividend announcement. During the research period, dividends were paid by 40 out of 72 companies listed on the NASDAQ OMX Baltic. A total of 168 dividend announcements have been made and analyzed in this paper. The results of the research revealed that within the analyzed event windows, positive AARs exist; however, they are not statistically significant. Positive AARs obtained 3 or 7 days after the dividend announcement imply that stock prices do not drop shortly after the dividend announcement, which would indicate weak NASDAQ OMX Baltic market efficiency.",

            "abstract": "Abstract In the era of emerging technologies, many firms explore the role of blockchain technology and its impact on corporate market value. Past research has shown that companies benefit from executing blockchain projects, but little is known about specific value and risk drivers. Hence, we provide evidence for several conditions under which blockchain provides additional firm market value. Moreover, we test whether blockchain announcements lead to changes in the systematic risk of firms. Theoretically founded on the resource-based view, we utilize the event study methodology, supplemented by a multivariate regression and a firm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s beta analysis. We find that stock markets react positively to corporate blockchain news if the announcement is related to a blockchain consortium or partnership, is declared by a tech company, or if the announcement is a follow-up announcement to initial blockchain news. Moreover, our findings show that blockchain announcements do not lead to significant changes in a firm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s systematic risk.",

            "title": "Risk Adjusted Returns to Technical Trading Rules: a Genetic Programming Approach",
            "abstract": "Background This paper is a continuation of our investigation of the paradox of technical analysis in the stock market (Fyfe, Marney and Tarbert (1999), Marney et. al (2000)). The Efficient Markets Hypothesis (hereafter the EMH) holds that there should be no discernible pattern in share price data or the prices of other frequently traded financial instruments, as financial markets are efficient. Prices therefore should follow an information-free random-walk. Nevertheless, technical analysis is a common and presumably profitable practice among investment professionals. Applications of Genetic Programming and Genetic Algorithms to the extraction of Technical Trading Patterns from financial data. The subset of technical trading research which is concerned with the application of GAs, GPs and neural networks is very new and underdeveloped and therefore of considerable potential. The most notable empirical work which has been done in this area is that of Neely, Dittmar and Weller (1996, 1997), Neely and Weller (2001) and Neely (2001). We have also done some work in this area ourselves (Fyfe et al. 1999, Marney et al. 2000). The theoretical underpinning for this kind of approach to finding technical trading patterns is provided by the work of Arthur et al. (1997). Using the main six trading currencies, Neely et al. (1996, 1997) find strong evidence of economically significant out-of-sample excess returns to technical trading rules identified by their genetic program. In Allen and Karjaleinen (1999) a genetic algorithm is used to find technical trading rules for the S&P index. Compared to a simple buy-and-hold strategy, these trading rules lead to positive excess returns which are statistically and economically significant. In Fyfe et. al. (1999), a GP is used to discover a successful \u00c3\u008ebuy\u00c3\u008c rule. This discovery, as such, however, was not really a refutation of the EMH, as it was really a form of timing specific buy and hold, which was triggered only once. Nevertheless, the return is superior to buy and hold. Using the S&P 500 index, Neely (2001) finds no evidence that technical trading rules identified by a GP significantly outperform buy-and-hold on a risk-adjusted basis. For the case of intraday trading on the forex market, Neely and Weller (2001) find no evidence of excess returns to trading rules derived from a GP and an optimised linear forecasting model. Indeed Neely (2001) observes that a number of studies\u00c3\u00b7'have generally evaluated raw excess returns rather than explicitly risk-adjusted returns, leaving unclear the implications of their work for the efficient markets hypothesis' (2001, p.1). On the other hand, Neely et al. (1996, 1997) did calculate betas associated with foreign currency portfolio holdings, and did not find evidence of excessive risk bearing. Brown, Geotzman and Kumar (1998) and Bessember and Chan (1998) can also be cited in favour of the hypothesis of superior risk-adjusted returns from technical trading signals. Marney et al. (2000) looked again at their 1999 findings by, amongst other things, adjusting for risk. It was found that although there were other rules which apparently performed well by being very active in the market, the impressive returns to these rules turn out on closer inspection to be illusory, as risk adjusted returns did not compare well with simple buy and hold. Nevertheless, paradoxically, we did find a useful role for technical trading. It is possible to substantially improve on buy and hold by timing it right. Hence our argument is that it is worth analysing the market to find a good intervention point. Purpose and method of the investigation Given that very little work has been done on generating technical trading rules which produce excess risk-adjusted profits, and given that the empirical evidence is somewhat ambiguous, there is clearly considerable scope for additional work in this area. What we propose to do then is to re-examine our previous findings, this time within a more rigorous framework which makes use of a wider data set, more extensive use of techniques of risk adjustment, and more demanding assessment of the robustness of the result with respect to GP representation. 1. Hypotheses Can the GP generate technical trading rules which will generate risk-adjusted excess returns out of sample? Secondly, the is there any further evidence for 'timing-specific' buy and hold. Thirdly, are there any technical trading rules which generalise across data sets or time-periods? 2. Data Set Our data set is drawn from long time series for 5 US shares from a disparate set of industrial sectors and also the S&P 500. 3. Risk adjustment In this study we look at a variety of risk measures including Betas, Sharpe ratios and the X* statistic. 4. The GP - As in Marney et al. (2000) we consider how robust our conclusion is with respect to the GP method used.",

This paper examines for the Swiss stock market whether insiders can earn abnormal profits and whether outsiders can make abnormal profits by mimicking the transactions of insiders. We find significant abnormal returns for insider trading, as well as some evidence for profitable mimicking strategies. We can reject the strong form Efficient Market Hypothesis for the Swiss stock market. However, with regard to the semi-strong form Efficienct Market Hypothesis, it remains unclear whether it is true for the Swiss stock market.",

            "abstract": "Contemporary state of the art of financial time series modelling is connected to the Efficient Market Hypothesis according to which ?prices fully reflect all available information? and hence future evolutions are unforecastable. In simple terms, EMH states that by predicting the future development we are not able to achieve the profits superior to the profits of the market index when these are adjusted for the risk and transactions costs are deducted. On the other hand, there exist works providing evidences that markets are not efficient. In these works, however, the strategies (or technical trading rules) are demonstrated to provide the extra performance in short term only and then the extra performance vanishes. In the paper we apply moving averages in order to define automated trading system and then analyze its profitability in Czech stock market. The results are statistically tested and statistical inference about the applicability of such an automated trading system in Czech stock market is made.",

This study employs event study methodology to show that there were few days in which the average abnormal return (AAR) and cumulative average abnormal return (CAAR) are statistically significant. In addition, this study also further investigates the abnormal return (AR) and cumulative abnormal return (CAR) for individual companies. It was found that majority of the stocks returns fell significantly 30 days after the UMA announcement. The magnitude of the fall in returns ranges from 4% to 234%. Hence, it is not advisable for investors to buy stock after UMA announcement.",

            "abstract": "During the latest episode of general election held in Malaysia, it is observed that the FBMKLCI index was lifted 62.52 points in a day soon after the announcement of election outcome. Moreover, the index registered a highest gain of 96.29 points in the middle of the intra-day trade. This suggests that investors who had got the right direction could make profitable intra-day trading the next trading day of the general election date. Results from statistical analysis uncover significant before-election-effect and after-election-effect from the most recent general elections held in Malaysia. Different subsets of macroeconomic variables are found to have significant role on stock market return depending on the market situation. Remarkably, when there was close fight between the two major political parties during the 2008 and 2013 election years, political uncertainty showed up its negative and significant role in influencing the stock market return. The major implication of these findings is that while investors may seek abnormal returns before and after the next general election, which is around the corner, they will have to pay attention on the influence of macroeconomic variables and political uncertainty on stock market return during the election year.",
