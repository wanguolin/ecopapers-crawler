            "abstract": "This paper uses intra-day data for the period 2002 through 2008 to examine the intensity, direction, and speed of impact of US macroeconomic news announcements on the return, volatility and trading volume of three important commodities \u00e2\u0080\u0093 gold, silver and copper futures. We find that the response of metal futures to economic news surprises is both swift and significant, with the 8:30am set of announcements \u00e2\u0080\u0093 in particular, nonfarm payrolls and durable goods orders \u00e2\u0080\u0093 having the largest impact. Furthermore, announcements that reflect an unexpected improvement in the economy tend to have a negative impact on gold and silver prices; however, they tend to have a positive effect on copper prices. In comparison, realized volatility and volume for all three metals are positively influenced by economic news. Finally, there is evidence that several news announcements exert an asymmetric impact on market activity variables.",

            "title": "Volatility spillovers between oil and equity markets and portfolio risk implications in the US and vulnerable EU countries",
            "abstract": "This paper examines the frequency dynamics of volatility spillovers between Brent crude oil and stock markets in the US (S&P500 index), Europe (STOXX600 index), Asia (Dow Jones Asia index) and stock markets of five vulnerable European Union (EU) countries known as the GIPSI (Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain, and Italy). We use the methodologies developed by Diebold and Yilmaz (2012) and Barun\u00c3\u00adk and K\u00c5\u0099ehl\u00c3\u00adk (2018) and the in-sample VaR performance to achieve our objectives. The results show that the spillover effect between the oil and the considered stock markets is time-varying, crisis-sensitive, and frequency-dependent. In addition, this effect had intensified during the onset of the 2008\u00e2\u0080\u00932009 Global Financial Crisis, the plunge of oil prices that started in the mid-2014, and the occurrence of COVID-19. Furthermore, the results also demonstrate that oil is a net receiver of risk in the system, irrespective of the time horizon. Among the GIPSI markets, the larger and highly indebted EU economies of Italy and Spain are net contributors of risk, while the smaller EU economies of Greece, Ireland, and Portugal as well as Asia are net receivers of risk, also regardless of the time horizons. The US and European stock markets are net contributors of the spillovers, whereas the Asia equity index is a net receiver, irrespective of the frequencies. Finally, the AR(1)-FIGARCH model with the skewed Student-t distribution provides more accurate in-sample estimates in all markets. The hedging is more expensive in the long term than in the short term. The hedging is also more expensive during the ESDC period than the other turbulent periods considered in the study. The hedging effectiveness is also higher in the long term than in the short term, is crisis-sensitive, and depends on the time-investment horizon factor.",

            "abstract": "This study examines the impact of corporate news announcements released overnight on price discovery during the pre-opening period in the Australian Securities Exchange. Our results suggest that the presence of these announcements increases the efficiency of indicative opening prices and that the intensity of these announcements significantly influences the aggressiveness of pre-opening orders. Using earnings announcements to compare the speed of price adjustments in response to overnight and daytime information of a homogeneous type, we find that prices respond immediately to overnight news upon the commencement of trading, whereas adjustments based on trading-hours news tend not to be instantaneous. Overall, our evidence highlights the important role of the pre-opening period in price discovery and the prospect of further enhancing this role by timing the release of public information to occur during non-trading hours.",

Our findings show that the day of the week effect is present. The highest and lowest mean daily returns of the S&P/TSX Composite index are detected on Tuesday and Monday, respectively. Moreover, we try to give an explanation of the day of the week effect by referring to the world market risk. Using unconditional and conditional models, our results reveal that only the significant Monday effect is still present after accounting for world market risk. Then, we can deduce that the Monday effect in returns of the S&P/TSX Composite index is not explained by the risk-return relationship and that it is an anomaly of the Canadian stock market.",

            "abstract": "A large class of fixed income trading strategies focuses on opportunities offered by the interest rate term structure. This paper studies a set of yield curve trading strategies that are based on the view that the yield curve mean-reverts to an unconditional curve. These mean-reverting trading strategies exploit deviations in the level, slope and curvature of the yield curve from historical norms. We consider cash-neutral trades with one-month holding periods. Some mean-reverting strategies were found to be highly profitable, and outperform, on a risk-adjusted basis before transaction costs, alternative strategies of an investment in the Lehman Brothers Bond index (by up to 5.9 times) and an investment in the S&P index (by up to 5.1 times). Even after accounting for transaction costs, some of these strategies are still significantly more profitable than the benchmarks. Furthermore, transaction costs can be reduced substantially by changing the trading frequency or through structured derivative trades. We found evidence that market efficiency has improved, and the scope for excess returns has diminished since the late 1980s",

Before making a decision to invest. Therefore, investors need various information as a guide to decide the investment in capital market. Profit is one the potential information contained in the financial statement that is mostly used to determine the success or failure of corporate management. The variables in this research consist of current ratio (CR), debt to equity ratio (DER) and net profit margin (NPM) as independent variable and profit growth as the dependent variable. The sample used is a pharmaceutical manufacturing company listed in the Indonesia Stock Exchange which has a complete annual financial report during the observation period (2012-2016). The analysis used is descriptive quantitative method, through descriptive statistical analysis, classical assumption test, multiple linear regression test and hypothesis test. Based on the test result, it is proven that the CR, DER and DER influence the prediction of the profit growth of 33.80% simultaneously. Partially, CR has no effect on predicting profit growth, DER and DER has positive effect on predicting earnings growth.",

Graham's model was widely examined in various developed market where the stock markets and companies are more mature and economy of the countries are more stable. However, the selection criteria model was not commonly examined in emerging countries despite of their rapid economic growth and diversified sectors in the stocks trading. Hence, this study attempts to investigate the relevance of Graham's stock selection criteria on the portfolio returns of the Saudi Arabia stock market. Saudi Arabia represents the fastest growing market in the Middle East primarily Arabian Gulf Cooperation Council region thus testing the market is justified. The study found that despite of being young and immature stock market, Saudi stock market was able to offer abnormal return to the investors and Graham's model of stock selection is indeed valuable to investors.",

The sample consists of 292 IPOs listed on Bursa Malaysia between May 2003 and December 2012. IPO lockup in Malaysia is mandatory as opposed to voluntary where it is negotiated between firms and underwriters. Using the market model event study method, the result shows a significant negative abnormal return at the expiration of the lockup period. Thus, the study provides evidence that contradicts the semi-strong form of the efficient market hypothesis (EMH). According to EMH, the expiration of the lockup period which is public knowledge should not be accompanied with a significant abnormal return. In addition, the study also shows the existence of higher abnormal trading volume at lockup expiration.",

Using the market reaction in the three-day period surrounding the announcements of extreme earnings surprises (i.e., SUE) in quarter Qt as a reference point, we show that firms reporting a high (low) SUE in subsequent quarter Qt+1 that confirms their initial quarter Qt SUE ranking in the same highest or lowest SUE quintiles generate an incremental price run that moves in the same direction as that of the initial SUE. However, the price impact of the confirming SUE signal is weaker than that of its initial SUE. Our findings are robust to the Fama-French three-factor daily regression extended by the momentum factor and a number of other robustness tests. Our result is not consistent with the prevalent view that investors underreact to earnings news. To the contrary, the evidence suggests an initial investor overreaction to extreme SUE signals.",

We inform this debate by examining the extent to which stock return synchronicity is associated with post-earnings announcement drift (PEAD) in China. We find that firms with higher synchronicity exhibit less pronounced PEAD and that this negative association weakens for firms with high institutional ownership. The findings suggest that in the Chinese stock markets, where retail investors are in the majority, idiosyncratic returns reflect noise rather than firm-specific information on average, and institutional investors play a role in reducing noise in idiosyncratic returns.",
