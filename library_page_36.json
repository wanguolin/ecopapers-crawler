            "abstract": "This paper analyzes the investor sentiment effect in four key European stock markets: France, Germany, Spain and the UK. The findings show that sentiment has a significant influence on returns, varying in intensity across markets. The variation appears to involve both stock characteristics and cross-country cultural or institutional differences. The results also show sensitivity to the choice of sentiment proxy, suggesting the need for further investigation.",

            "abstract": "This study investigates the random walk (RW) and the martingale difference sequence (MDS) processes for the Australian dollar and seven Asian currencies relative to three benchmark currencies between 1993 and 2008. We use Kim's (2009) Automatic Variance Ratio (AVR) test for the RW and Kuan and Lee's (2004) test for the MDS. The null of RW or MDS hypotheses is not rejected for three currencies: Australian dollar and Korean won for the post-Asian financial crisis period tested by MDS, and Malaysian ringgit for the entire test period as well as the pre-Asian financial crisis period when the currency is evaluated by the AVR. As for the post-Asian crisis, six other Asian currencies including Malaysian ringgit show no discernible improvement toward market efficiency. Our findings have broad policy implications \u00e2\u0080\u0094 investors may be able to exploit time-varying movements of the returns of the five currencies which can be identified by technical trading rules for profitable trading.",

            "abstract": "This study compares the valuation of REITs and non-REITs, using firm-level return and accounting data of 168 REITs and 3,215 industrial companies and the methodology of Vuolteenaho (2002) that separates variances driven by cash flow news and expected return news. The evidence shows that, relative to industrial firms, REITs are driven more by cash flow risk. However, the difference in cash flow risk is insignificant after controlling for leverage. Furthermore, in poor market conditions the valuation of REITs is closer to that of non-REITs, a result we interpret as evidence of a leverage effect. These results point to leverage as an important driver of cash flow risk. In addition, cash flow risk of small firms is found to be on average lower than that of larger ones.",

            "abstract": "This paper presents a multi-period trading sentiment asset pricing model under asymmetric information. In the model, the rational investor trades on information so that the information is gradually incorporated into prices, whereas the sentiment investor trades on sentiment as if it were information. Moreover, the speed of information incorporated into price becomes faster and faster, while the speed of sentiment factored into price gets slower and slower over time. We find that the existence of sentiment investor makes financial market possible, but decreases market efficiency. The model also offers a partial explanation to the financial anomalies of short-run momentum and long-term reversal.",

            "abstract": "Our study analyzes in detail the results of the credit risk effect by using data from the unique rating environment of Taiwanese stock markets. Even in distinct institutional settings, our empirical results reaffirm the well-known inverse relationship of returns and credit risk, which is robust with regard to cross-sectional and time-series scrutiny. We reveal that the underperformance of low-rated firms around their rating downgrades, when they are subject to both severe illiquidity and short-sale constraints, partially explains the abnormal returns of long\u00e2\u0080\u0093short portfolios, although the returns remain substantial when data associated with downgrades is removed. When targeting delisted firms, we observe that delistings among the lowest-rated firms exhibit extremely poor returns near the time of their downgrades. We find that the abnormal returns become insignificant in the long\u00e2\u0080\u0093short portfolio in the sample, from which delistings are excluded. Our empirical evidence suggests that market mispricing of delisted stocks near the time of their downgrades is a primary cause of the credit risk puzzle.",

            "abstract": "Using the turnover decomposition model, we extract unexpected trading volume from trading activity to measure divergence in investors' opinions and explore the explanatory power of that divergence on stock returns. Portfolios built according to the magnitude of opinion divergence are significantly profitable. The expected returns of portfolios with small opinion divergence are significantly higher than other portfolios, particularly for small companies. When this pricing factor is included in the CAPM and the Fama\u00e2\u0080\u0093French three-factor model, the influence of opinion divergence on stock returns during the current month is significantly positive, but it is significantly negative for the next month. When further considering liquidity, momentum reversal and other factors, the conclusion is still valid.",

This study aims to contribute to the existing literature of examining bitcoin returns under a financial asset purview. Through multiple robust tests, the market efficiency of daily bitcoin returns is analyzed for the time frame of July 2010 till March 2018. Strong evidence of market inefficiency characterized by absence of random walk model is found. The market inefficiency was found attributable to the presence of asymmetric volatility clustering. More studies are needed to examine the temporal dynamics of bitcoin returns.",

Chinese and Indian markets are not exempt. Inefficiencies in these markets are described by many authors as roots of all mispricing. Mispricing might be the outcome of application of familiar asset pricing models which may mislead an investor into adopting inappropriate policies for his new investments or for reallocating his old investments. In an alternative approach, we propose a transformation on original market returns in the objective of relaxing the strong assumption of market efficiency behind application of an asset pricing model. This modification will widen the scope of rational models on asset pricing ranging from an efficient to an inefficient market.",

Using 1083 unique customer\u00e2\u0080\u0093supplier relationships for the period 1983\u00e2\u0080\u00932011, I find that the cumulative abnormal returns of a supplier surrounding and following linked customers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 earnings announcements are positively related to the earnings information of the customers, suggesting that customer earnings announcements convey information to suppliers.

We generate 15-min price movement configurations based on high-low-open-close (HLOC) patterns and measure liquidity in terms of spread, depth, order imbalance, dispersion and slope. We also consider trading activity and volatility measures. Based on an event study methodology, we find that particular HLOC configurations are associated with higher liquidity in the limit order book. Although these effects are short-lived, market participants could benefit from temporary higher liquidity by executing their trades when these price configurations occur.",

Very often, this indicator in conjunction with the return on equity (ROE) is used in analyzing investment projects.

This research examines the behavior of the return on capital by means of the Vasicek model. Moreover, under certain conditions, the capital cost is estimated through the Vasicek model. Finally, it shows that the return on equity and the inverse of the multiple price-book value are consistent with dynamics showing mean reversion",
