            "abstract": "Abstract Short sale orders account for a substantial portion of trading volume in recent years. This paper develops a sequential trade model with constrained short selling to derive the effect on prices when the market maker can observe short selling in the order flow. The model predicts that market quotes will adjust differently to short sales and regular sales. Furthermore, the model shows that the probability of informed trading is impacted both by the level of short sale constraints and the intensity of actual short sale trades. Simulation evidence confirms that estimates of the probability of informed trade are improved when accounting for past short selling activity. The results demonstrate the information benefits of short selling transparency.",

We find that investor attention causes changes in sentiment but not vice versa. Moreover, the effect of attention on sentiment is short-lived for medium and large stocks although persists for small stocks. We also document the existence of an important mediating role of attention in the link between sentiment and aggregate stock returns. Investor attention alters the predictability value of sentiment in future aggregate returns, providing new insight into the information content of investor sentiment as it relates to investor attention. We find that sentiment caused by investors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 inattentiveness mainly drives the underlying potent relationship between investor sentiment and aggregate stock returns. Our results accord with the notion that investor attention generally improves market efficiency.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Do index futures still lead the spot market over government intervention or under trading restrictions? This intriguing question can be explored in the context of the 2015 Chinese market turmoil with frequent government interventions and its aftermath when unprecedentedly severe restrictions were imposed on the trading of the CSI 300 index futures. The intraday price discovery, studied via VECM, became weakly bidirectional over the boom phase from October 2014 to June 2015, in contract to the index futures\u00e2\u0080\u0099 strong leading before the boom. The futures\u00e2\u0080\u0099 leading status weakened drastically over the crash phase between June and September 2015, probably due to the government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interference with the stock market. Surprisingly, the futures under severe trading restrictions after the crash from September 2015 to June 2016 still led the spot weakly, and the volatility spillover to the index was somewhat significant. Policywise, the empirical findings imply that government interventions or trading restrictions weaken the functioning of markets.",

            "abstract": "Abstract This paper examines the added-value of combining traditional valuation ratios with each other as well as with some financial statement variables in the German stock markets during the 2000\u00e2\u0080\u00932015 period. The results show that combination pays off and, moreover, that the benefits of combination are greater in Germany than in most other developed stock markets. Particularly, we find strong evidence of the added-value of using Piotroski\u00e2\u0080\u0099s F-score as a supplementary selection criterion for value stocks as well as for low-accrual stocks. Our results show further that the F-score also boosts the efficacy of other valuation ratios besides the book-to-price ratio. In addition, the inclusion of F-score besides a relative value measure tends to increase the average market equity of portfolio firms. The decomposition of the full-sample-period performance into separate bull- and bear-period performance shows clearly that the better performance of F-score-boosted portfolios is mostly attributable to their outperformance during bearish periods, even though on average, they also generate higher bull-period returns than the comparable value portfolios formed without F-score. The use of F-score as a supplementary criterion also increases the proportion of stocks that earn above-market-average returns during the subsequent holding period. For the first time in the financial literature, we also document a strong relationship between high F-score stocks and momentum stocks.",

            "abstract": "This study investigated how airline stock prices respond to fuel price shocks using the asymmetric Glosten-Jagannathan-Runkle GARCH (GJR-GARCH (1,1)) model. Six airlines were selected, based on their service regions: American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, and United Airlines are larger international carriers that use various types of aircraft in their fleets and provide services in major continents, whereas Southwest Airlines, JetBlue Airways, and US Airways emphasize domestic market services and primarily use single-aisle aircraft. West Texas Intermediate Crude Oil (WTI) prices were adopted as the index of fuel prices. Based on our empirical results, a fuel price shock triggered fluctuations in airline stock returns. Moreover, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United, Airlines and US Airways experienced statistically significant negative relationships between their stock returns and fuel price shocks. Also, fuel price shocks significantly impacted airline stock returns during periods in which fuel prices increased but did not correlate with them during those in which such prices fell",

            "abstract": "This paper presents an overview of several econometric tools available to test for the presences of asset price bubbles. For demonstrative purpose, the tools were applied to historical stock price and dividend data starting from 1871 through 2014. The earliest tools developed were Shiller\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s variance bound tests and West\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s two step procedure. Though these tools are useful in detecting asset prices, they are subject to some serious econometric issues. To address these limitations, Cointegration methods were used to detect asset price bubbles. Unfortunately, if there are collapsing bubbles, Cointegration techniques cannot identify multiple bubbles. To overcome this Phillips, Shi and Yu (2015) developed a right tailed Augmented DickeyFuller test. This test not only identifies multiple bubbles but also dates the starting and ending period of a bubble. Availability of such real time monitoring tool would significantly help investors, retirees, and portfolio managers to rebalance their portfolios during such bubble periods",

            "abstract": "Abstract Holding earnings surprises constant, investors react negatively to delayed earnings announcements. One standard deviation of delay (5 days) corresponds to about 21 bps negative abnormal returns over a two-day announcement window. We show that the results are robust after further controlling for various firm characteristics, earnings characteristics, and the industry effect. We examine alternative explanations, including the earnings manipulation hypothesis proposed in the literature, which suggests that delayed earnings announcements are susceptible to manipulation and are thus discounted by investors. We find no evidence supporting the earnings manipulation hypothesis. Instead, our results are consistent with the effect of concurrent information disclosure. We show that there is a cluster of bad news for late announcements. As investors react to not only a firm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own announcements but also concurrent earnings announcements, the negative information of concurrent announcements contributes significantly to lower stock returns. In addition, information update by the management and analysts also has a significant effect on market reactions to delayed announcements. In particular, information update by analysts may help the market to incorporate future earnings information more efficiently into stock prices. We show direct evidence that negative market reactions to delayed earnings announcements contain information of future earnings.",

Using textual analysis, we develop a simple measure of such misleading information based on the difference between the emphasis placed on business lines in the main textual description and the corresponding information from the accounting tables. We examine our measure of misleading information using a sample of 1878 IPOs in China from 2010 to 2019. We find that the degree of misleading information is greater when firms find it more difficult to get regulatory approval for an IPO. Furthermore, the amount of misleading information is greater for firms with higher leverage and more segmented businesses. We also find some evidence that the stock returns of firms which present a greater amount of misleading information are lower.",

            "abstract": "This paper examines the impact of market states on the profitability of momentum strategies using weekly data from the Taiwan Stock exchange over the 10-year period 1997-2006. Market states refer to the states of market such as up or down markets. In this paper, the formation period is defined as in an up (down) state if the market return over the six-month period prior to the holding period is nonnegative (negative). The results indicate that market states in the formation period are positively associated with the profitability of the momentum strategies. The results are consistent with the overreaction theory developed in Daniel et al. (2004). Moreover, the empirical results indicate that market states in the holding period are negatively associated with the profitability of the momentum strategies. The holding period is defined as in an up (down) state if the market return in the six-month period following the formation period is nonnegative (negative). The momentum profits appear to be higher in a bearish holding period and lower for a bullish holding period. Thus, the market states in the holding period also provide information regarding the profitability of the momentum strategies.",

Empirical results show that the riskneutral skewness tends to be more (less) negative under bearish (bullish) investor sentiment, and the significant relations become stronger especially when there are more impediments to arbitrage in stock options. In addition, the empirical results show that increased bearishness among market investors who dominate the use of index options increases the extent to which risk-neutral skewness is affected by fluctuations in investor sentiment for the underlying stocks. Empirical results show that the limits of arbitrage have important implications for the role of investor sentiment in explaining risk-neutral skewness",

We make two key contributions to the literature. First, we employ a robust event study methodology based on Fama-French Momentum Model with EGARCH to explore the price/volume dynamics associated with DJIA Index additions and deletions. Second, we extend earlier work by incorporating all index reconstitution announcements after Dow Jones & Company began preannouncing index changes in 1990. Our results show that index additions (deletions) experience temporary increases (decreases) in stock prices following the announcement. The abnormal returns surrounding the announcements are economically and statistically significant. In addition, both inclusions and removals lead to temporary abnormal trading volume increases in the post-announcement period. However, the stock prices and trading volumes revert within a few trading days. Our findings are consistent with the price pressure hypothesis as the documented abnormal returns and trading volumes are not permanent.",
