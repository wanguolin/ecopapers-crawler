            "abstract": "This study examines the impact of investor attention and analyst coverage on the diffusion of information. Using trading turnover as a proxy for investor attention, the results show that attention is crucial to the information diffusion from financial analysts. The effect of analyst coverage on improving stock synchronicity is greater when investors are more attentive. Firms with less analyst coverage rely more heavily on investor attention to assimilate information. The lead\u00e2\u0080\u0093lag effect in high and low analyst-following firms is driven by the relative more attention given to firms that have high analyst coverage.",

            "abstract": "In this paper we separate the total stock return into its continuous and jump component to test whether stock return predictability should be attributed to omitted risk factors or behavioral finance theories. We extend results from the US market to the Spanish stock market, which, despite being a developed market, presents several differences in terms of stock characteristics, financial system, investor typology and cultural dimensions. The results show that the jump component has significant explanatory power for the premium of three characteristics (size, book-to-market and illiquidity), which is at odds with risk-based explanations. Using the same testing strategy, we try to shed some light on an important controversy concerning the relationship between default risk and momentum. The results suggest that default risk is not the source of momentum returns.",

            "abstract": "This paper surveys and critically evaluates the literature on the role of management effects and fund characteristics in mutual fund performance. First, a brief overview of performance measures is provided. Second, empirical findings on the predictive power of fund characteristics in explaining future returns are discussed. Third, the paper reviews the literature on fund manager behavioural biases and the impact these have on risk taking and returns. Finally, the impact of organizational structure, governance and strategy on both fund risk taking and future performance is examined. While a number of surveys on mutual fund performance are available, these have not focused on the role of manager behavioural biases, manager characteristics and fund management strategic behavior on fund performance and risk taking. This review is an attempt to fill this gap. Empirical results indicate that finding successful funds ex-ante is extremely difficult, if not impossible. In contrast, there is strong evidence that poor performance persists for many of the prior \u00e2\u0080\u009closer fractile\u00e2\u0080\u009d portfolios of funds. A number of manager behavioural biases are prevalent in the mutual fund industry and they generally detract from returns.",

            "abstract": "In this paper, we examine whether widely documented properties of equity-based volatility indices apply to US Treasury bond volatility indices (TBVIXs). We calculate TBVIXs in a model-free way using the market prices of five-, ten- and 30-year Treasury futures options over a sample of more than 20years. The empirical findings of this study reveal that changes in TBVIXs are positively correlated with changes in both Treasury yield rates and US non-fixed income and European equity-based volatility indices. Our analysis also shows that changes in Treasury yield rates Granger cause changes in TBVIXs and that past changes in TBVIXs help explain current changes in equity-based volatility indices (and vice versa). Finally, we find that TBVIXs fall following scheduled macroeconomic news announcements and that the response of TBVIXs to news releases depends to some extent on the magnitude and sign of the surprise in the announcement. This study's findings have implications for volatility risk management using the recently listed futures on the Chicago Board of Options Exchange's ten-year Treasury note volatility index.",

            "abstract": "The practice of periodically reconstituting equity indices suggests that changes to the composition of an index can impact the performance of firms whose stocks are added to or dropped from the index. This paper reviews and provides a comprehensive assessment of the academic literature on how changes in the composition of a stock index impacts prices, trading volume and other firm attributes. The review focuses on post-2000 contributions. It highlights and critically discusses major areas of controversy, disagreement and debate in both the empirical and methodological literature, and puts forth a promising agenda for future research. This is the first comprehensive survey of studies on the index effect and it should be particularly useful to portfolio managers and investors.",

Taking the case of the Chinese stock market, we obtain firm-level data from the Taiwan Economic Journal database and consider the A-shares listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges. Using a rolling portfolio approach, we examine three contrarian strategies. We provide theoretical evidence to argue that the disposition effect could be the major driving force of short-term contrarian profits, and provide empirical evidence from the Chinese stock market to support our argument. Our findings could be of considerable interest to researchers and practitioners interested in the Chinese stock market.",

In this paper, we propose that investors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 anchoring bias is state-dependent that varies with the level of the 52-week high. Using the ratio of 52-week high to historical high to capture the state-dependent nature of anchoring biases, we show that price momentum and 52-week high momentum generate significant profits only when the stock's 52-week high approaches its historical high. When the 52-week high is far from the historical high, both strategies exhibit no momentum profit.",

Using issuer credit rating announcements as an informational event, we find that both IVS and the short fee have significantly higher predictive power for returns on event days versus non-event days. Both also predict the direction and magnitude of credit rating changes. Consistent with the linkage between the short sale and options markets, in models with both explanatory variables, the short fee remains significant in all specifications, while IVS loses explanatory power.",

Comovement increases in the month of and the month following the disaster before declining back to normal levels. The disaster impact is stronger in recessions and crisis periods but is evident in all periods. The increased return correlation stems more from an increase in covariance than an increase in stock or market standard deviation. Moreover, we show climate events have a greater impact on comovement in stocks with greater sensitivity to their local economy and higher information asymmetry.",

The relation weakens with stock illiquidity, whereas it strengthens when short positions originate from informed agents, such as hedge funds, active investors, and short sellers with high past performance.
