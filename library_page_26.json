            "abstract": "Firms that switch from NASDAQ to the NYSE between 1988 and 2000 show an increase in the comovement of their order flows with aggregate NYSE order flow, and a decline in comovement with NASDAQ order flow. These changes in comovement are coincident with the switch, large relative to firms that remain on NASDAQ and the NYSE, and not explained by the growth in indexing over the sample period, a possible selection bias inherent in the decision to switch to the NYSE or a delayed response to cross-market information. Cross-sectional analysis shows that large, institutionally owned, value-oriented and dividend paying firms experience greater changes in comovement following the move to the NYSE. Our evidence is consistent with an important role for style investing in generating excess comovement, as in Barberis and Shleifer (2003).",

            "abstract": "An association between increased index futures mispricing and concurrent index volatility has been reported within several prior studies; in the present study, we argue that expected volatility over an arbitrage horizon also has an adverse effect on the ability and willingness of traders to engage in arbitrage, leading to greater and more persistent futures mispricing. Using the CBOE VIX and its innovation on the concurrent spot volatility as proxies for expected volatility, we present evidence of an increase in S&P 500 index futures mispricing with expected volatility. The impact of the VIX grows exponentially across the distribution of conditional mispricing levels, which suggests that the expectations of heightened future volatility become increasingly detrimental to arbitrage activities when the futures price deviations are enlarged; however, the influence of expected volatility is found to have been reduced during the global financial crisis period, a period during which concurrent volatility overwhelmingly dominated the magnitude of mispricing.",

            "abstract": "This Paper examines the price differences between very liquid on-the-run US Treasury securities and less liquid off-the-run securities over the entire on/off cycle. Unlike previous studies, by comparing pairs of securities as their relative liquidity varies over time, we can disregard any cross-sectional differences between the securities. Also, since the liquidity of Treasury notes varies predictably over time we are able to distinguish between current liquidity and expected future liquidity. We show that the more liquid security is priced higher on average, but that this difference depends on the amount of expected future liquidity over its remaining lifetime rather than its current liquidity. We measure future liquidity using both quotes and trades. The liquidity measures include bid-ask spread, depth and trading activity. Examining a variety of liquidity measures enables us to evaluate their relative importance and to identify the liquidity proxies that most affect prices. Although all the measures are highly correlated with one another, we find that quoted bid-ask spread and quoted depth are more important than effective spread and trade size, respectively. Among measures of market activity, however, the number of trades and volume are more related to the liquidity premium than the number of quotes.",

            "abstract": "This paper introduces a real-time, continuous measure of national sentiment that is language-free and thus comparable globally: the positivity of songs that individuals choose to listen to. This is a direct measure of mood that does not pre-specify certain mood-affecting events, nor assume the extent of their impact on investors. We validate our music-based sentiment measure by correlating it with mood swings induced by seasonal factors and weather conditions. We find that music sentiment is positively correlated with same-week market returns and negatively correlated with next-week returns, consistent with sentiment-induced temporary mispricing. Results also hold under a daily analysis and are stronger when short-sale constraints limit arbitrage. Music sentiment also predicts increases in net mutual fund flows, and absolute sentiment precedes a rise in stock market volatility.",

This paper examines how time-series forecast dispersion is distinct in the relation to stock returns from the negative dispersion-return relation. We find that contrary to the previously-known negative dispersion-return relation, there is a strong positive relation between time-series forecast dispersion and stock returns. We also find that time-series forecast dispersion apparently contains systematic risk components and that such risk is priced in stock returns.",

            "abstract": "We identify crucial events during the European sovereign debt crisis and investigate their impact on the euro currency. In particular, we analyze how specific announcements related to vulnerable eurozone member states, European Central Bank (ECB) actions, and credit rating downgrades affect the value and the crash risk of the euro. We proxy the appreciation and depreciation of the euro by its abnormal foreign exchange (FX) rate returns with respect to 35 currencies. The crash risk of the euro is proxied by the conditional skewness of the FX rate return distribution with respect to the same currencies. We find that the market reacts positively to news related to countries under EU/IMF rescue umbrella. We discover that ECB actions on average result in a euro depreciation on the day of the announcement reflecting obvious concerns of market participants, but the effect is partly reversed the day after. Our analysis also shows that sovereign and corporate credit rating downgrades tend to lead to a depreciation of the euro and, more importantly, to an increase of the euro crash risk. Interestingly, we find that specific announcements about Greece on average do not substantially affect the euro exchange rate directly; however, it does have an overall significant effect on the euro crash risk, imposing a substantial risk for the stability of the common currency in the eurozone.",

            "abstract": "I investigate whether the cross-autocorrelation pattern of US small- and large-firm returns changes with the variance of returns using an exponential vector autoregressive model with volatility. The model allows the testing of dynamic cross-autocorrelation effects, while controlling for own time-varying autoregressive coefficients. Using daily and weekly data from 1965 to 2015, a constant cross-autocorrelation pattern is rejected. Returns on a large-firm portfolio are found to lead returns on a small-firm portfolio. The lead-lag relation changes over time with the variance of the large-firm returns. Traditional vector autoregressions with constant cross-autoregressive coefficients appear to be overly restrictive when testing lead-lag relations in stock markets.",

We postulate that the perceived negative IVOL-expected return relation could be the artifact of the confounding effect of public news arrivals. Using the stock return data from the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) database and the news database from the RavenPack News Analytics over the period from 2000 to 2011, we show that the strength of the positive relation is reduced systematically by 50% after accounting for the arrivals of good and bad news releases, which are defined by their sentiment scores. This finding is robust to numerous model specifications, and the inclusion of firm-level characteristics, liquidity risk and information risk. When we restrict the firm-specific news to value-relevant news, the positive relation disappears. We conclude that that the public arrivals of firm-specific news play a significant role in explaining the IVOL puzzle.",

Our model relates relative spreads to directed information flows and begets a set of testable implications. Although conventional wisdom dictates that futures prices lead equities, our model predicts the opposite should be true when particular relative price conditions hold for the bids and offers of each asset. We develop an empirical measure of price discovery which is suited to asynchronous, high-frequency financial data and test the model predictions. Empirical evidence strongly supports the relative spread mechanism.",

Motivated by the recent literature that suggests an increase in crash risk since Fall 2008 and the recent troubles in the Euro zone, we use EUR/USD FX options for January 2, 2008 to March 18, 2015 to study option-implied risk-neutral densities (RND). We find that RND, especially higher moments, has superior explanatory power in predicting and explaining crash risk and its risk premiums. Furthermore, the higher moments of RND co-move closely with macroeconomic variables. Consistently, we find RND moments outperform the implied volatility from the Black\u00e2\u0080\u0093Scholes model.",

Using the cross-sectional dispersion in real-time forecasts of real GDP growth as a measure for ambiguity, we find that high ambiguity beta stocks earn lower future returns relative to low ambiguity beta stocks.
