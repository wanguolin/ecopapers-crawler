            "abstract": "Non-fundamental demand shocks have significant effects on asset prices, but observing these shocks is challenging. We use the exchange-traded fund (ETF) primary market to study non-fundamental demand. Unique to the ETF market, specialized arbitrageurs called authorized participants correct violations of the law of one price between an ETF and its underlying assets by creating or redeeming ETF shares. We show theoretically and empirically that creation and redemption activities (ETF flows) provide signals of non-fundamental demand shocks. A portfolio that is short high-flow ETFs and long low-flow ETFs earns excess returns of 1.1\u00e2\u0080\u00932.0% per month, consistent with non-fundamental demand distorting asset prices away from fundamental values. Moreover, we show non-fundamental demand imposes non-trivial costs on investors, leading to underperformance.",

            "abstract": "This paper examines the calendar effects in ten South Eastern European (SEE) stock markets daily returns during the period 2007 - 2014. We focus on three calendar effects: the day of the week effect, the half month effect and the turn of the month effect. Specifically, we analyze existence of each calendar effect separately in the mean and in the volatility of the index returns. We apply standard regression models with dummy variables for the effects in the mean returns, while we apply GARCH(1,1) models with dummy variables for the effects in the volatility of returns. The results present evidence that the day of the week effects in both mean and volatility are present in nine out of ten SEE stock markets. Contrary, the half month effect in mean returns is present only in one SEE stock market, while half month effect in volatility is present in five out of ten SEE stock markets. The turn of the month effect in mean returns is present in six out of ten SEE stock markets. The turn of the month effect in volatility is present in all SEE stock markets.",

Empirical results suggest that there are multiple structural breaks on variance of returns series and A-FIGARCH model outperforms. In addition, it is found evidence in favor of long memory on the conditional variance of returns series and hence it can be said that Borsa \u00c4\u00b0stanbul is not weak form efficient market.",

It relies on the concept of behavioral finance, which analyzes the impact of psychology on investor decision-making. The influence of atmospheric phenomena is mainly studied as impact of occurrence of snow, rain or fog on the market returns. The research results show the impact of these phenomena only in a minority of cases. The research also analyzes the impact of the autumn season (SAD effect) on the psychology of investors and therefore market returns. This sequence wasn't rebutted only at the Czech stock market. The incidence of observed atmospheric effects also failed to explain the January and Monday effects.",

            "abstract": "We examine the impact of the Russia-Ukraine war on the value of global currencies against the US dollar (USD) using event study methodology and market model estimates. We show that the Russia-Ukraine conflict had a negative impact on the value of the global currencies; however, a region-by-region analysis shows that while European currencies (particularly the Russian rouble, Czech koruna, and Polish zloty) depreciated against the USD, Pacific currencies appreciated significantly, and the currencies of the Middle East and Africa (ME&A) are insignificant. We also show that due to the financial and economic sanctions imposed on Russia, as well as Poland and the Czech Republic's proximity to the war zone, their currencies have weakened significantly against the USD. Furthermore, the Russian Central Bank's announcement to peg the rouble with gold, has had a significant positive impact on the pan-American, European (particularly the Russian rouble and the Polish zloty), and ME&A currencies. The analysis reveals a group of currencies that are unaffected by exogenous shocks. Incorporating these stable currencies into a portfolio would reduce the risk of volatile currencies. Future research can help gain additional insights by combining them with other major currencies such as the Chinese yuan, Japanese yen, British pound, and euro.",

Through the contribution of Bannier et al. (2019b), the first finance-related dictionary is available for the German language. Because of the novelty of this dictionary, this paper proposes several reforms and extensions of the original word lists. Additionally, I tested multiple measurements of sentiment. I show that using the edited and extended dictionary to calculate a relative measurement of sentiment, central assumptions regarding textual analysis can be fulfilled and more significant relations between the sentiment of a speech by a CEO at the Annual General Meeting and subsequent abnormal stock returns can be calculated.",

            "abstract": "Many questions about institutional trading can only be answered if one can track high-frequency changes in institutional ownership. In the U.S., however, institutions are only required to report their ownership quarterly in 13-F filings. We infer daily institutional trading behaviour from the ?tape?, the Transactions and Quotes database of the New York Stock Exchange, using a sophisticated method that best matches quarterly 13-F data. We find that daily institutional trades are highly persistent and respond positively to recent daily returns but negatively to longer-term past daily returns. Institutional trades, particularly sells, appear to generate short-term losses - possibly reflecting institutional demand for liquidity - but longer-term profits. One source of these profits is that institutions anticipate both earnings surprises and post-earnings-announcement drift. These results are different from those obtained using a standard size cutoff rule for institutional trades.",

The expected idiosyncratic volatility is conditioned on macro-finance factors as well as traditional asset pricing factors. The macro-finance factors are constructed from a large set of macroeconomic and financial variables. Our results show that the negative relation between expected idiosyncratic volatility and stock returns reverses to a positive one when accounting for the macro-finance effects. Portfolio analysis shows that the positive relation is economically important. The relation between expected idiosyncratic volatility and returns is not affected by business cycle variations. The empirical results are highly robust.",

Our measures contribute to market realized variance and excess return prediction suggested by in- and out-of-sample tests. Accounting for LJ identified by jump variation improves market return forecast, implying a distinct impact of large and non-LJ.",

(2006), this paper empirically analyzes the conditional correlation between treasury and swap markets from February 9, 2006 to May 31, 2011, and makes two key contributions. First, the dynamics of the conditional correlation of only the 2-year maturity differs from those of other maturities. These patterns might be explained by the fact that a 2-year maturity is easily affected by market forecasts of monetary policy changes by the Federal Reserve Board. Second, the financial crisis dummies (\u00ce\u00be1) are all negative in particular with significance at the 5% level for 7 year, 10 year, and 30 year maturities. This result indicates that arbitrage transactions between treasuries and swaps have not taken place on a sufficient scale during the financial crisis period. As Ito (2010) points out, market participants have been uncertain about the direction of the monetary policies of these financial institutions.",
