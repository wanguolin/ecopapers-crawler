            "abstract": "We find that weekend, holiday and overnight trading breaks generate excessive perceived risk in the option markets, presumably due to asymmetric information, which, in turn, encourages uninformed option traders to postpone trading. This perceived risk subsides after two days accompanied by an increase in the option trading volume and the underlying index\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actual price volatility. These results shed light on the informational role of index options and suggest that the theoretical models\u00e2\u0080\u0099 results regarding information processing and price discovery in the presence of private information are not limited to single stocks but also apply to the market as a whole.",

Whilst green firms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 performance has been formally studied in terms of returns and pricing (Bolton and Kacperczyk, 2022; P\u00c3\u00a1stor et al., 2022), far less is known about their volatility. We analyze the volatility of green and brown firms from 2012 to 2021, through the multiple lens of GARCH, machine learning, and historical volatility. The unconditional volatilities of brown and green firms are similar. The forecasting of volatility, however, differs sharply between green and brown firms: it is much harder to forecast green firms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 volatility.",

            "abstract": "This paper shows that tail risk in US equity markets increased in advance of the COVID-19 outbreak in February 2020. While tail risk of the market index did not move much before the outbreak, we document that tail risk of less pandemic-resilient economic sectors boomed in advance. This result is robust to alternative specifications of tail risk, measured from either option or credit default swap contracts. Long-horizon tail risk measures provide information about investors perception of pandemic risk persistence and economic recovery.",

            "abstract": "CONTENTS: This paper analyses the role of liquidity in the price discovery process. Specifically, it focuses on the credit derivatives markets in the context of the subprime crisis. It presents a theoretical price discovery model for the ASP, bond and CDS markets and then it tests the model with data from 2005 to 2009 on Euro-denominated non-financial firms. The empirical results show that the ASP market clearly leads the bond market in the price discovery process in all cases, while the leadership between ASPs and CDSs is very sensitive to the appearence of the subprime crisis. Before the crisis the CDS market leads the ASP market but during the crisis the ASP market leads the CDS market.",

            "abstract": "We study the impact of technical analysis in a context of heterogeneous, utility-maximising agents. A framework is provided to capture observed diversity in forecast estimates as a result of interaction between prior beliefs and asymmetric information. Using investment decisions of fundamentalists as a benchmark, agents\u00e2\u0080\u0099 optimal demand difference, which reflects expectation heterogeneity and the use of technical analysis, offers insights into the endogenous uncertainly in asset pricing behaviour. Technical analysis results in price feedback. We define a new family of feedback rules over cumulative distribution functions. Using bifurcation analysis, we show how prices asymptotically approach equilibrium and how significant feedback effects drive them off the equilibrium path. Both trend chasing strategy and contrarian strategy among technical trades are described in the model: the latter leads prices to overshoot the fundamental value with a high frequency; whereas in the former case, prices exhibit prolonged cyclic behaviour.",

            "abstract": "This study investigates the number of state variables needed for CDS pricing by conducting a principal component analysis using CDS data for the 2006-2009 period. Two state variables, approximated by the first two components, are found sufficient for pricing CDS spreads. The first component corresponds to a market level factor and can explain over 97% of the variation in the data, resulting in a 20.04 bps root mean square error (RMSE). The second component corresponds to a liquidity level factor and can explain an additional 1.7% of the variation, helping to reduce the RMSE to 5.29 bps. A rigorous bootstrap test, together with two robustness tests, on the model performance improvement corroborates our conclusions. The study sheds light on CDS pricing and provides support for the most recent findings that liquidity risk is priced in CDS spreads.",

Our results strongly suggest that there exist arbitrage opportunities in the KOSPI 200 options market.",

However, the traditional realized volatility (RV) representation is not robust to abrupt jumps in nowadays volatile globalized financial markets. This study includes other alternatives of jump-robust realized volatilities namely the bipower, minimum and median nearest neighbor truncation (NNT) volatility proxies in the examination of the heterogeneous market hypothesis (HMH) through the extension of heterogeneous autoregressive (HAR) model specifications. The empirical results show that the aforementioned alternative realized volatilities provide better forecast evaluations as compared to the standard realized volatility. Thus, the alternative realized volatility proxies are better explained the heterogeneous market hypothesis. In addition, the combination forecast models using three weighting schemes indicated better forecast performance as compared to the individual forecast. To complete this study, we illustrate a value-at-risk determination for the emerging Brazilian stock exchange.",

The net result of this trading activity, which is unrelated to economic fundamentals, can be to push interest rates further in the direction they were moving. Such \u00e2\u0080\u009cfeedback\u00e2\u0080\u009d effects interfere with the short-term dynamics of interest rate movements and can alter the shape of the yield curve, especially when changes in interest rates are large. Our empirical results confirm the existence of a positive feedback from the activity in the euro-denominated interest rate options market to the european yield curve. This finding can be useful for risk management purposes but also for analysts and policy makers when interpreting short-run movements in the yield curve as signals of future economic activity.",

            "abstract": "Numerous empirical studies dating back to Ball and Brown (1968) have investigated how markets react to the receipt of new information. However, it is only recently that authors have focussed on differentiating between, and learning from, how investors react to good and bad news. In this paper we find that investors swing between being optimistic and being pessimistic in their interpretation of the new information driven by not only the prevailing market uncertainty and sentiment but also by a significant number of firm-specific characteristics. Pessimism prevails when uncertainty is high, sentiment is weak and the information is being disseminated by companies that are lowly-valued, have high risk, are thinly traded and/or are small cap stocks. However, investors swing to being optimistic when one reverses some or all of these factors. The conclusion that we draw is that risk, uncertainty and the attitude of investors combine to determine how the markets react to new information and this flows through to asset valuations.",
