            "abstract": "This paper extends the work in Serletis and Shintani (2003) and Elder and Serletis ( 2006) by re-examining the empirical evidence for random walk type behavior in the U.S. stock market. In doing so, it tests the random walk hypothesis by employing unit-root tests that are designed to have more statistical power against nonlinear al- ternatives. The nonlinear feature of our model is re ected by three regimes, one of which is characterized by a unit root process and the random walk hypothesis while the lower and upper regimes are well captured by a stationary autoregressive process with mean reversion and predictability.",

            "abstract": "This paper examines the efficiency of the forward yan/dollar market using micro survey data. Conventional tests of unbiasedness do not correspond directly to the zero-profit condition. Instead, we use the survey data to calculate potential profits of individual forecasters based on a natural trading rule.We find that although the survey data are not the best predictor of future spot rates in terms of typical mean square forecast error criteria, the survey data can be used to obtain on average positive profits. However, these profits generated by a trading rule using regression forecasts. The profits are found to be correlated with risk type variables but not other available information.",

            "abstract": "The impact of the US and European macroeconomic news on the USD/EUR volatility was examined by using the Flexible Fourier Form method. News increased volatility significantly, and the US news was the most important. The much-tested hypothesis of bad news having a greater impact on volatility was re-confirmed. The announcements were also divided into two categories, the first containing the news that gave conflicting information on the state of the economy and the other containing the news that were consistent. Conflicting news were found to increase volatility significantly more and faster than consistent news.",

            "abstract": "Hedging the risk of holding undesired inventory is very important for market makers. However, prior studies seldom capture the role of inventory positions in measuring hedging costs. This study measures hedging costs directly using data on inventory positions of market makers in the Taiwan Index Options market. We break down rebalancing costs into two sources: rebalancing costs due to inventory changes and rebalancing costs due to delta changes. Contrary to prior studies on stock options, we find rebalancing costs are more important than initial hedging costs in explaining option spreads. Our findings underscore the importance of inventory management.",

            "abstract": "Various macroeconomic announcements are known to influence asset price volatility. In addition to non-farm payrolls, we highlight the importance of Treasury auctions \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a news event that has grown in importance due to ongoing Federal deficits. The occurrence of an auction, which increases supply in the underlying cash market, pushes futures prices lower and volatility higher. Conversely, a higher bid-to-cover ratio, indicates greater demand for Treasury securities, increases Treasury futures prices and lowers volatility. The response is consistent with market participants using futures to manage inventory risk. The results are consistent across a set of volatility estimates, and in an alternate conditional volatility framework.",

            "abstract": "This paper examines how news releases, key microstructure features of market activities and crude oil futures returns affect trading frequency in U.S. airline stocks. Using the autoregressive conditional hazard framework of Hamilton and Jorda (2002), we show that on average, trading intensity spikes prior and consequent to macroeconomic announcements, but decreases around firm specific releases. We find that market microstructure variables have a small yet significant effect on trading frequency, with high trade volume and narrow bid/ask spread inducing higher trading intensity. Strong evidence is provided to indicate that the intraday crude oil futures returns are relevant for modelling the probability of a trade in airline stocks within the next time period.",

We prepared a model of a market reaction and found out that the market is not significantly driven by new macroeconomic figures. The sharpest moves have never been caused by a new number, but developments abroad and unexpected statements of central bankers. Scheduled central bank decisions on the interest rates did not affect yields as much as these two factors. The main message of this text for short term investors is, that in contrast to the USA, it is better for them to follow trading abroad than the Czech fundamentals.",

Along with the popular Black-Scholes and \\model-free\" implied volatility expectations, the recently proposed corridor implied volatility (CIV) measures are explored. For all pair-wise comparisons, it is found that a CIV measure that is closely related to the model-free implied volatility, nearly always delivers the most accurate forecasts for the majority of the firms. This finding remains consistent for different forecast horizons, volatility definitions, loss functions and forecast evaluation settings.",

We find no evidence supporting that investors consider exposure to risk factors when they evaluate VIX ETP performance.

            "abstract": "[Purpose] The aim of this paper is to analyse the performance of the Nifty 50 and selected sectoral indices. Further, an attempt is made to examine the effect of various festivals on the performance of these indices. [Design/methodology/approach] For study purposes, closing prices of Nifty 50 and selected sectoral indices have been collected from the NSE India for the period of January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2021. The study employs descriptive statistics to know about the sample mean, standard deviation, sample variance, maximum, minimum, skewness, and kurtosis. Paired t-test was used to compare the returns of indices before and after the festival. Unit root test was used to test stationarity. Finally, the Granger causality test was applied to study the relationship between the Nifty 50 and sectoral indices returns. [Findings] According to this study, higher returns have been found for indices during Ramadhan and Christmas. Investors purchasing and selling behaviour is more positive during these times. During the pre-covid 19 period, Christmas is the only festival that shows positive returns in all sectoral indices. There is a positive return of all indices on Ramadhan and Diwali days during covid 19 period. The paired sample t-test showed that among all the festivals, Diwali is the only festival, which has an impact on the Nifty 50 and Nifty Auto index. The Granger causality test discovered a bidirectional relationship between Nifty Oil & Gas and Nifty health care, as well as Nifty 50 and Nifty Bank. [Originality/value] Festivals are one of the factors that attract investors into the market. It implants a positive attitude in the minds of investors. Decision science enables investors to analyse, quantify, and track the performance of their investments in different sectors. The findings of the study would be useful to investors, to come up with some investment strategies and maximize their returns during the festival season. Fund managers can restructure and allocate their funds based on sectoral indices performance.",

            "abstract": "The aspiration of this research paper is to investigate the impact of international gold prices on the equity returns of Karachi Stock Index (KSE100 index) of Pakistan Stock Exchange. The daily observations from January 1, 2000 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 June 30, 2016 have been divided into three sub-periods along with the full sample period on the basis of structural breaks. Descriptive analysis used to calculate the average returns, which showed significant returns of KSE100 for the full sample, the first and the third sample periods as compared to gold returns. Standard deviation depicted the higher volatility in all the sample periods. Correlation analysis has shown an inverse relationship amid equity returns and gold returns, whereas, Philips-Perron and Augmented Dickey-Fuller tests have been employed, and time series data became stationary after taking the first difference. Johansen cointegration results have shown that the series are cointegrated in the full-sample and the first sample periods. Thus, this has demonstrated the long run association amid equity returns and gold returns in the first sub-sample and the full-sample periods. However, the second and the third sub-sample periods do not exhibit long-term association amid equity returns of KSE100 and gold returns. The outcomes of Granger causality approach identified bidirectional causation amid equity returns and gold returns in the full sample period in lag 2, and unidirectional causality has been observed from gold prices to stock prices in the full sample and the first sub-sample periods in lag 1 and lag 2 respectively.",
