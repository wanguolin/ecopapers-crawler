            "abstract": "We develop a model of temporary short-selling bans by extending the infinite-horizon model of Scheinkman and Xiong (2003). Our model predicts that a temporary short-selling ban leads to a speculative bubble that is the highest at the beginning of the ban and gradually converges to zero. Examining the 2008 short-selling ban in the U.S., we find evidence consistent with the model\u00e2\u0080\u0099s predictions. The innovation of our empirical design is to use the financial segments of non-banned stocks as a control group for the banned financial stocks. Our results are robust across different test specifications and different samples of stocks.",

            "abstract": "We present evidence that the pricing of the probability of informed trading (PIN) information risk varies substantially with stocks\u00e2\u0080\u0099 short selling environment. For lightly shorted stocks, their risk-adjusted returns (alphas) increase reliably with both the good news (PIN_G) and bad news (PIN_B) components of their PIN. The positive PIN-alpha relations decline and then disappear as stocks\u00e2\u0080\u0099 shorting activity increases. Our findings are consistently evident with shorting-interest, shorting-flow, and the probability of informed shorting, and are more prominent for smaller-cap stocks. Our findings support theories where asymmetric information with imperfectly competitive markets can impact stocks\u00e2\u0080\u0099 cost of equity.",

Our analysis of U.S. option data reveals a positive cross-sectional relationship between the upside asymmetry (RML) and subsequent option returns. This relationship cannot be explained by stock or option characteristics studied in previous literature and do not reverse in the following months. Additionally, the relationship is stronger among firms with higher costs of arbitrage. RML robustly predicts future realized and implied volatilities after controlling for historical volatility and lagged implied volatility.",

Around the same reforms, the ability of this CDS-unique information to predict future stock returns decreased. These results suggest the CDS market has become less of a \u00e2\u0080\u009chidden\u00e2\u0080\u009d trading venue for informed investors since central clearing and trade reporting started.",

Moreover, venues that do not disclose their type of business as well as venues in Europe, North America and Oceania increase crypto volatility.

We analyze the time period between January and June 2020 and demonstrate that while most of the investment funds exhibit stressed performance, social entrepreneurship funds endured resilience. This performance remained robust during the various stages of evolution of this contagion. The social funds also demonstrated volatility timing that was absent for most of their counterparts. We attribute the overall stability of these funds to their niche investments in social enterprises that specialize in providing innovative solutions for social issues.",

This study focuses on understanding the regime change from lower to higher volatility identified with a Markov Switching AR model. Utilizing machine learning feature selection methods, economic indicators are chosen to best explain changes in volatility. Results show that volatility is affected by specific economic indicators and is sensitive to COVID-19 news. Both negative and positive COVID-19 information is significant, though negative news is more impactful, suggesting a negativity bias. Significant increases in total and idiosyncratic risk are observed across all industries, while changes in systematic risk vary across industry.",

The relative outperformance of the ESG portfolio, reported by Nofsinger and Varma (2014) and Lins et al. (2017), comes from the fact that the probability of its returns getting affected by the other safer investment strategies increases during an economic slowdown. It implies that investors become more attentive to corporate fundamentals \u00e2\u0080\u0093 causing capital flowing away from the defensive and EAFE portfolios to the ESG portfolio during crisis periods. Investors find refuge in the ESG approach as it focuses on the long-run sustainability of firms.",

Nevertheless, and differently from Collin-Dufresne and Fos (2015), we find that the option bid\u00e2\u0080\u0093ask spread may be still a good proxy for informed trading, despite of the liquidity searching behaviour of informed agents. We show an upward trend in the option bid\u00e2\u0080\u0093ask spread after option introductions (as informed traders avoid trading in initial periods after listing dates due to the low liquidity environment), which is steeper for options with high chances of information asymmetries.",

We employ Mean Variance spanning methodologies in a classical unconditional setting and a novel conditional setting. Fixed-weight optimal portfolios stemming from the unconditional methodology indicate that all the strategies are needed to enhance the mean\u00e2\u0080\u0093variance tradeoff. This conclusion is completely reversed when we allow for time-varying portfolio weights as a nonlinear function of lagged economic indicators. The overall results suggest that diversified anomaly-based holdings are of limited benefit to sophisticated investors who employ dynamic trading strategies.",
