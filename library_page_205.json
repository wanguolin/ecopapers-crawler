            "abstract": "We propose a method to extract individual firms' risk-neutral return distributions by combining options and credit default swaps (CDS). Options provide information about the central part of the distribution, and CDS anchor the left tail. Jointly, options and CDS span the intermediate part of the distribution, which is driven by moderate-sized jump risk. We study the returns on a trading strategy that buys (sells) stocks exposed to positive (negative) moderate-sized jump risk unspanned by options or CDS individually. Controlling for many known factors, this strategy earns a 0.5% premium per month, highlighting the economic value of combining options and CDS.",

            "abstract": "Exploiting a unique identification strategy based on inaccurate news analytics, we document a causal effect of news analytics on the market irrespective of the informational content of the news. We show that news analytics speed up the stock price and trading volume response to articles, but reduce liquidity. Inaccurate news analytics lead to small price distortions that are corrected quickly. The market impact of news analytics is greatest for press releases, which are timelier and easier to interpret algorithmically. Furthermore, we provide evidence that high frequency traders rely on the information from news analytics for directional trading on company-specific news.",

            "abstract": "The paper examines the relation between nominal share price and price momentum, explicitly controlling for nominal share price levels. The results show that very high/low nominal share price stocks lack price momentum and utilize more systemic risk which remains even controlling for stock splits. While splitting a stock allows firm managers to keep the nominal share price constant, thereby increasing firm value and attracting more investors, it also increases the likelihood of uninformed trading by those with limited budgets and risk share capacity. As a result, splitting a stock causes stock information to diffuse more slowly, leading to higher price momentum.",

Using a semiparametric variant of the methodology in Breeden and Litzenberger (1978), we investigate the fit and smoothness of distributions derived from alternative PDF estimation methods, and develop a set of robust summary statistics. Using PDFs estimated around episodes of high geopolitical tensions, oil supply disruptions, and macroeconomic data releases, we explore the extent to which oil price movements are expected or unexpected, and whether agents believe these movements to be persistent or temporary.",

            "abstract": "In this paper we study the repurchasing behavior of individual investors and identify several characteristics (stock- and investor-specific) that affect the preference for repurchasing stocks previously owned. Using a unique database of 5,128 individual investors trading from August 1st, 2003 to July 31st, 2007, we find that investors prefer to repurchase stocks that are prior winners and those that dropped in price after being sold, in line with Strahilevitz, Odean and Barber (2011). We also find that the larger the prior gain, or the drop in stock price after the sell, the more likely is the investor to repurchase the same stock. Additionally, we find that (1) local stocks with negative market adjusted performance are more likely to be repurchased, and (2) less active, under-diversified, and poor performance investors are more likely to engage in such behavior. Overall, our results indicate that reference prices, prior stock returns, stock visibility, and investor performance and sophistication are determinants of the repurchasing behavior.",

            "abstract": "We examine the predictive power of market-based indicators over the positive and negative stock market bubbles via an application of the LPPLS ConfidenceTM Multi-scale Indicators to the S&P500 index. We find that the LPPLS framework is able to successfully capture, ex-ante, some of the prominent bubbles across different time scales, such as the Black Monday, Dot-com, and Subprime Crisis periods. We then show that measures of short selling activity have robust predictive power over negative bubbles across both short and long time horizons, in line with the previous studies suggesting that short sellers have predictive ability over stock price crash risks. Market liquidity, on the other hand, is found to have robust predictive power over both the negative and positive bubbles, while its predictive power is largely limited to short horizons. Short selling and liquidity are thus identified as two important factors contributing to the LPPLS-based bubble indicators. The evidence overall points to the predictability of stock market bubbles using market-based proxies of trading activity and can be used as a guideline to model and monitor the occurrence of bubble conditions in financial markets.",

            "abstract": "This paper makes use of two types of extreme value distributions, namely: the generalised extreme value distribution often referred to as the block of maxima method (BMM), and the peak-over-threshold method (POT) of the extreme value distributions, to model the financial tail risks associated with the empirical daily log-return distributions of the sharia-compliant stock index and three regional conventional stock markets from 01/01/1998 to 16/09/2014. These include the Dow Jones Islamic market (DJIM), the U.S. S&P 500, the S&P Europe (SPEU), and the Asian S&P (SPAS50) indexes. Using the maximum likelihood (ML) method and the bootstrap simulations to estimate the parameters of these extreme value distributions, we find a significant difference in the tail risk behaviour between the Islamic and the conventional stock markets. We find that the Islamic market index exhibits fat tail behaviour in its right tail with high likelihood of windfall profit during extreme market conditions probably due to the ban on short selling strategies in Islamic finance. However, the conventional stock markets are found to be more risky than the Islamic markets, and exhibit fatter tail behaviour in both left and right tails. Our findings suggest that during extreme market conditions, short selling strategies lead to larger financial losses in the right tail than in the left tails.",

Using weekly portfolio fund flows data, the paper finds that their short-run dynamics are driven mostly by global \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093push\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac factors. To what extent do these cross-border flows and global risk aversion drive asset volatility in EMs? We use a Dynamic Conditional Correlation (DCC) Multivariate GARCH framework to estimate the impact of portfolio flows and the VIX index on three asset prices, namely equity returns, bond yields and exchange rates, in 17 emerging economies. The analysis shows that global risk aversion has a significant impact on the *volatility* of asset prices, while the magnitude of that impact correlates with country characteristics, including financial openness, the exchange rate regime, as well as macroeconomic fundamentals such as inflation and the current account balance. In line with earlier literature, portfolio flows to EMs are also found to affect the *level* of asset prices, as was the case in particular during the global financial crisis.",

This helps to explain why empirical research based on different time periods finds conflicting results regarding the existence of the size premium. This transitional dynamics also suggests that market frictions may explain the size premium. The effect is pervasive and it is present in different periods in the United States, and in the United Kingdom; considering the Fama/French SMB factor or the individual size portfolios; and controlling for market risk.",

The expected annual premium is around 9% in these states and insignificant otherwise. This fact is inconsistent with the unconditional version of the ICAPM, which predicts a negative size premium. The ICAPM does not condition down because of the time-varying risk premium, but there is almost no evidence that the conditional version of the ICAPM is consistent with the properties of the premium either.

This is when the cross-sectional differences in risk premiums dominate the differences in expected cash flows connecting size and risk. Otherwise, value links better to the same risks, as it scales size by a proxy for expected cash flows. The hypothesis that value and size are (constant) risk proxies is formally rejected in the data, challenging the use of size-related portfolios as risk factors along with several strands of the literature based on this hypothesis.",

Within a general, frictionless, rational expectations, risk-based asset pricing framework, riskier assets tend to be in the loser portfolios after (large) increases in the price of risk. Hence, the risk of momentum portfolios usually decreases with the prevailing price of risk, and their risk premiums are approximately negative quadratic functions of the price of risk (and the market premium) theoretically truncated at zero. The best linear (CAPM) function describing this relation unconditionally has exactly the negative slope and positive intercept documented empirically.",
