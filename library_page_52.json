            "abstract": "This article uses event study methodology through Seemingly Unrelated Regressions estimates (SUR), which allows controlling the data clustering phenomenon, in order to assess primarily the effect on D&S stock returns during the takeover announcement of its stocks by Walmart. The empirical results show significant abnormal returns of 32.2% during the announcement days. Thus, the entry of Walmart was reflected in the stock prices, which is associated with higher efficiency through increases in the expected future cash flows of the company.",

            "abstract": "Abstract This article is a contribution towards the growing empirical literature on the relationship between liquidity and pricing of credit default swaps (CDSs). To the best of my knowledge, the article becomes the first to show that market liquidity does matter to CDS pricing in Japan, by looking into a sole benchmark index of CDS trading for investment-grade debt claims, or the Markit iTraxx Japan (MiJ). The impact of illiquidity on MiJ premia has declined since the International Swaps and Derivatives Association introduced new trade practices in April 2009. The liquidity of the MiJ has increased since the Japan Securities Clearing Corporation started operating as a central counterpart for the MiJ in July 2011. The price discovery ability of the MiJ has also increased since then.",

Using a mispricing indicator that measures deviations from a stock\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fundamental value, we find higher levels of short selling for temporarily overvalued stocks. The result is robust to controlling for short sale constraints and illiquidity, and it is more pronounced when short sale constraints do not bind and stocks are illiquid. We also find that informed short sellers are able to distinguish temporary overpricing from upward return momentum. However, when fundamental news is released, short sellers focus on exploiting negative fundamental changes rather than temporary overpricing. Short sellers contribute to market quality by correcting overpricing quickly over time, but they do not destabilize the market.",

            "abstract": "Abstract This paper empirically explores the short- and long-run effects of fiscal and monetary policies on US stock returns and tests the validity of market efficiency. The results support the presence of a strong long-run (equilibrium) relation binding stock prices with fiscal (but not monetary) policy. Further tests assign a dominant role to fiscal policy as a main force driving the overall equilibrium relation with the stock market. Estimates from error-correction models corroborate the existence of robust long-run relation and further suggest that past fiscal (but not monetary) policy actions exert significant short-run effects on current stock returns. A similar verdict emerged from alternative estimates in which fiscal policy actions anticipated from an ex ante equation continue to support a significant lagged relation with current stock returns. These results provide consistent evidence that important effects of fiscal policy are transmitted to the real economy through the stock market. Moreover, the results for fiscal policy appear at variance with market efficiency. However, transaction costs and other well-known modeling caveats may impede implications for profitable investment strategies.",

            "abstract": "Abstract We evaluate the robustness of momentum returns in the US stock market over the period 1965\u00e2\u0080\u00932012. We find that momentum profits have become insignificant since the late 1990s. Investigations of momentum profits in high and low volatility months address the concerns about unprecedented levels of market volatility in this period rendering momentum strategy unprofitable. Momentum profits remain insignificant in tests designed to control for seasonality, up or down market conditions, firm size and liquidity. Past returns, can no longer explain the cross-sectional variation in stock returns, even following up markets. Investigation of post holding period returns of momentum portfolios and risk adjusted buy and hold returns of stocks in momentum suggests that investors possibly recognize that momentum strategy is profitable and trade in ways that arbitrage away such profits. These findings are partially consistent with Schwert (Handbook of the economics of finance. Elsevier, Amsterdam, 2003) that documents two primary reasons for the disappearance of an anomaly in the behavior of asset prices, first, sample selection bias, and second, uncovering of anomaly by investors who trade in the assets to arbitrage it away. In further analyses we find evidence that suggest two other possible explanations for the declining momentum profits, besides uncovering of the anomaly by investors, that involve decline in the risk premium on a macroeconomic factor, growth rate in industrial production in particular and relative improvement in market efficiency.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Previous research finds a positive and significant relation between current increases in R&D expenditures and future abnormal stock returns. While the existence of this anomalous pattern is well-established, its underlying causes are the subject of much debate. Recent research also shows that transaction costs can lead to apparent market anomalies such as the post-earnings-announcement drift. We combine these two lines of research and posit that the positive relation between R&D increases and future abnormal stock returns is due to transaction costs. Consistent with this hypothesis, we find that abnormal returns on R&D-based, zero-net-investment portfolios disappear after incorporating standard measures of transaction costs. Overall, our results show that the R&D-abnormal return anomaly is more likely due to transaction costs than to the alternative hypotheses of market inefficiency or omitted risk factors.",

We find pre-announcement odd lot order imbalances are not positively correlated with post-announcement returns and odd lot traders do not earn excess returns. Portfolios long stocks highly bought by odd lot traders in the pre-announcement period and short stocks highly sold by odd lot traders do not outperform the market. We conclude that odd lot traders are not in possession of earnings announcement information prior to its release to the public.",

First, when we classify REIT institutional investors by their legal type, we find that the ownership of pension funds (bank trusts) is negatively (positively) related to REIT crash risk. In addition, the trading of investment companies, including mutual funds, has become positively related to REIT crash risk in recent years. Next, when we classify REIT institutional investors by their investment behavior, we find that REIT crash risk is positively related to the trading of transient institutional investors, which trade frequently to maximize short-term gains. Moreover, the adverse impact of transient investors on REIT crash risk has worsened recently. These findings highlight the heterogeneous impacts of different types of institutional investors on REIT crash risk, which has important implications for REIT market participants and policymakers.",

By studying the events, abnormal returns are calculated before and after the announcements made by the companies to the Comisi\u00c3\u00b3n para el Mercado Financiero. Positive and significant abnormal returns are observed in the days prior to the announcement in four of the five analysed cases. In addition, the average daily abnormal return is 6.85% between the day before and the day of the announcement, which is statistically significant.

Except for several subperiods associated with the half- and one-year window, the two series are tied together through cointegration and adjust equally toward the long-run relationship. Considering different forecasting lengths, the out-of-sample Granger causality test for each window generally reveals that no series gains forecastability from another. These results shed light on the evolving causal structure between the two series, which is determined to be stable. The futures market, however, has not been fully developed to serve as a price discovery source. Increasing openness of investment channels and policy incentives to attract well-informed traders may stimulate futures market development.",
