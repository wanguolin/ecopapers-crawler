            "abstract": "This article examines the magnitude of stock market reactions to European Central Bank (ECB) monetary policy announcements. Since the introduction of the ECB, declining absolute abnormal returns have been compatible with the theory that stock markets learn from ECB monetary policy. In particular, Eurozone financial markets extract information from the ECB announcements and consider this information before making investment decisions. Furthermore, the predictability of ECB monetary policy has been increasing over time.",

            "abstract": "This paper uses quantile regression techniques to investigate the temporal dependence patterns of major exchange rates around the globe. Specifically, we estimate quantile autoregressive models for daily exchange rate returns of the USD/EUR, USD/JPY, USD/GBP, USD/AUD, USD/CHF and USD/CAD exchange rates between 1999 and 2014. Testing for the equality of cross-quantile-effects, we reveal substantial state-dependence in the return dynamics. In particular, we find that large US dollar appreciations tend to exhibit positive dependence on past returns, whereas large US dollar depreciations tend to exhibit negative dependence on past returns. Around central return quantiles, however, there is virtually no evidence for significant temporal dependence. Exceptions from this pattern are only apparent for the USD/JPY and the USD/CHF exchange rate. Theoretically, our results point to the presence of over- and undershooting in terms of asymmetric exchange rate adjustment to previous day information.",

Using an event-study approach, we find substantial cross-sectional variation in a sample of 2625 non-financial firms in the Euro-zone. Announcement returns are positively correlated with leverage and negatively with size, consistent with a credit channel. Furthermore, announcement returns are negatively correlated with the market-to-book ratio, suggesting different exposures of value and growth stocks. These patterns are more pronounced once we only examine programme initiation announcements.",

            "abstract": "We examine the liquidity of 456 different cryptocurrencies, and show that return predictability diminishes in cryptocurrencies with high market liquidity. We show that whilst Bitcoin returns are showing signs of efficiency, numerous cryptocurrencies still exhibit signs of autocorrelation and non-independence. Our findings also show a strong relationship between the Hurst exponent and liquidity on a cross-sectional basis. Therefore, we conclude that liquidity plays a significant role in market efficiency and return predictability of new cryptocurrencies.",

It is argued that as Tether is the undisputed \u00e2\u0080\u0098stable coin\u00e2\u0080\u0099, the minting of new Tether acts similarly to monetary expansion in cryptocurrency markets, inflating the prices of Bitcoin.

We also document an increase in Tether trading following a subsequent decrease in Bitcoin returns.",

With hourly data we jointly perform the analysis estimating a bivariate error correction model. with GARCH perturbations, which captures stochastically the presence of an intraday U shaped curve for both spot and futures volatility. Consistent with previous studies for U .S., our findings show an unidirectional causal relationship from the futures to spot market, both in returns and volatilities. This empirical pattern suggests that futures markets leads spot market to incorporate the arrival of new information",

We present a new statistical arbitrage test based on the subsampling methodology which has lower Type I error than existing alternatives. Using four different databases covering the period from 2005 to 2009, long-run (cointegration) and statistical arbitrage analysis are performed. Before the subprime crisis, we find long-run arbitrage opportunities in 26% of the cases and statistical arbitrage opportunities in 24% of the cases. During the crisis, arbitrage opportunities decrease to 8% and 19%, respectively. Arbitrage opportunities are more frequent in the case of relatively low rated bonds and bonds with a high coupon rate.",

We propose a Kalman-filter-based methodology that allows us to deconstruct price series into the true efficient price and the microstructure noise. This approach allows us to employ volatility estimators that achieve very low Root Mean Squared Errors (RMSEs) compared to other estimators that have been proposed to deal with market microstructure noise at high frequencies. Furthermore, this price series decomposition allows us to estimate the variance covariance matrix of $n$ assets in a more efficient way than the methods so far proposed in the literature. We illustrate our results by calculating how microstructure noise affects portfolio decisions and calculations of the equity beta in a CAPM setting.",

Using the SSE 180 Index ETF from May 18, 2006 to December 8, 2020, we document that investors who apply technical rules on China's equity ETFs incline to do so because of the stylized fact that the skewness feature of technical analysis can meet their desire for it. We also find that investors should design a technical rule with a more reasonable and practical lag length of the price range (or the price change percentage) to fulfill their desire for higher skewness value. Moreover, we confirm that our empirical findings are robust even with the consideration of potential factors such as position constraint, market timing, reference return, market condition, transaction costs, and data-snooping bias.",

The results show that the factor model not only fits the gambling characteristics of the Chinese stock market well but also has strong explanatory power for common market anomalies. Through the index of capital gains over-hang (Wang et al., 2016), this paper further finds that facing different degrees of losses, investors will show different gambling preferences. The factor model also shows stronger explanatory power in the sample with more losses, revealing the investment characteristics of retail investors that the more you gamble and the more you lose. This study would be meaningful for exploring behavioral pricing factors, understanding emerging stock markets and supporting investment practice.",
