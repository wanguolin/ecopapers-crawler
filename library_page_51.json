            "title": "Frequency and Sequence: Convertible Debt Issuance Announcement Effect on Stock Returns",
            "abstract": "Convertible debt that shares the characteristics of debt and equity is perceived to be riskier than straight debt, therefore the issuance announcement tends to lead to adverse market reaction. In this study we show that convertible debt issuance announcement is also associated with negative abnormal returns with evidence from the Malaysia capital market. We argue that the substantially smaller and illiquid convertible debt market do not affect the consistency of the findings. However, the main purpose of this study is to examine the effect of frequency and sequence of convertible debt issuance announcement on the issuers stock return. We find that both the frequency and sequence of issuance significantly affect the announcement returns. In the longer event window, we observe negative abnormal returns for the infrequent issuers. While frequent issuers report positive abnormal returns. Looking at the sequence of issuance, the first issues of convertible debt lead to negative market reaction, but as the information gap decreases, subsequent issues of convertible debt lead to insignificant abnormal returns. We argue that the findings of this study are mainly related to the theories of asymmetric information and sequential financing. In brief, this study contributes to the convertible debt literature by highlighting the need to incorporate the effect of frequency and sequence in examining the announcement effect of securities. Furthermore, this study adds that the additional features of convertible debt such as redeemable, non-redeemable, secured and unsecured do have significant impact on the announcement returns.",

            "abstract": "This article examines whether mean reversion in stock index basis changes is actually induced by arbitrage trading, using intra-day arbitrage trade data. The empirical evidence suggests that arbitrage trading alone cannot account for all of the mean reversion in basis changes, even when infrequent trading is controlled for. This general mean reversion is consistent with mean reversion in liquidity and partial adjustment in the cash market. The behavior of arbitrageurs appears highly competitive. We find that on average the net arbitrage profit is at the competitive level of zero. Furthermore, it is suggested that some mispricing persistence may be related to time-varying liquidity. Accordingly, the results indicate that arbitrageurs pay attention to the depth of the market and value the early unwinding option.",

            "title": "The Effects of Market Strength, Information Asymmetry, and Industrial Characteristics on Malaysian Firms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 CAR During COVID-19 Pandemic",
            "abstract": "Research Question: Would the COVID-19 pandemic induce investment opportunities or threats for companies listed at Bursa Malaysia? Motivation: This study investigates whether the market strength and information asymmetry experienced during a crisis and industrial characteristics have an impact on shareholders\u00e2\u0080\u0099 abnormal returns. Idea: The study uses market strength as measured by trading volume and information asymmetry as measured by bid-ask spread aims to suggest potential investment opportunities in different categories of industries for investors. Data: The study uses data of 620 companies listed on Bursa Malaysia, collected from 16 Mar 2020 to 9 Jun 2020. The data were divided into 3 event windows based on the government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Movement Control Order (MCO) announcements. Method/ Tools: The event study method is used to calculate the cumulative abnormal returns (CAR) as the dependent variable. Multiple regression analysis with hierarchical model specifications were used in assessing the impact of the explanatory variables on the dependent variables. Findings: The findings suggest that during periods of uncertainty, firm characteristics such as larger and older firms are at a disadvantage compared to smaller and younger firms. In terms of market characteristics, the study shows that Increased trading volume has greater returns to investors. However, the bigger bid-ask spread associated with higher abnormal returns reflects the inefficiency of the stock market. This study also found that in the month following the announcement of the first MCO, the CAR of firms in vulnerable industries reduced by an extra 5% compared to firms who were not classified as vulnerable industry category. As the MCO prolonged, the CAR of firms in vulnerable industries fell by an extra 9.5% compared to other firms listed in Bursa Malaysia. The negative impact on the vulnerable industries shows glooming prospects of those firms. Contributions: Market reactions to pandemics and MCOs are negative especially at the beginning period. The strength of the market, information asymmetry, and industrial characteristics have a strong influence on the abnormal returns during the observed periods. The study also shows that historical financial track records are not good predictors of a firm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s prospects during this unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic.",

            "abstract": "This paper considers the effects of changes in the composition of the Danish blue-chip KFX index for the period of 1989-2001. Consistent with the selection criterion used for the index, there is no evidence for a stock price effect at the announcement of a change in the index. However, deleted stocks experience an abnormal return averaging \u00e2\u0080\u009313% in a six-month period before the deletion and a decrease in trading volume and efficiency of stock prices following the deletion. For added stocks, the average abnormal return is 8% and there is no significant change in trading volume or efficiency. These long-run effects are best explained by the imperfect substitutes hypothesis or the information costs/liquidity hypothesis, suggesting that stocks in the KFX Index are exposed to a higher demand or more attention and a lower cost of trading than stocks outside the index. However, the results do not rule out the possibility that part of the stock price effect is due to the selection criterion used for the KFX Index. All in all, this paper documents that the selection criterion for and the size of an index as well as the size of the related stock market are relevant when explaining the stock market effects of index revisions.ndex.

We use daily stock data of the Polish companies included in the WIG20 segment (the twenty most liquid companies quoted on the primary market of the Warsaw Stock Exchange). The sample covers the period from January 1995 to April 2005. We find that there is no empirical support for a relationship between stock return levels and trading volume. On the other hand, our calculations provide evidence for a significant contemporaneous interaction between return volatility and trading volume. Our investigations reveal empirical evidence for the importance of volume data as an indicator of the flow of information into the market. These results are in line with suggestions from the Mixture of Distribution Hypothesis. By means of the Granger causality test, we establish causality from both stock returns and return volatility to trading volume. Our results indicate that series on trading activities have little additional explanatory power for subsequent price changes over that already contained in the price series.",

The market reaction to this information is tested at different time horizons by means of event study methodology. The results show that market reaction is rather positive immediately before the announcement release and negative over the following six-day-period starting on the event day. A possible explanation for this phenomenon is suggested. Besides the traditional examination of abnormal return behaviour, we also check whether or not resignation announcements induce increases in the variance of stock returns over the period under consideration. It turns out that a tendency towards increased stock return volatility can be observed in the whole period prior to the announcement release.",

The findings show that while the U.S macroeconomic announcements cause significant jumps on all asset classes, European equity markets are found to be more responsive. Moreover, there is a strong correlation between the type of news and direction of the jumps. Significant cojumps caused by the U.S macroeconomic surprises across European stock indices futures are also reported. The time series analyses show that the European financial markets experienced more frequent and sizeable jumps during the recent global financial crisis. Similarly, more frequent cojumps are also reported across European equity markets during the same period.",

We run a horse race of different implied volatility estimates: at the money and out of the money call and put implied volatilities and average implied that is a weighted average of at the money call and put implied volatilities with weights proportional to trading volume. Two hypotheses are tested: unbiasedness and efficiency of the different volatility forecasts. The investigation is pursued in the Dax index options market, by using synchronous prices matched in a one minute interval. The results highlight that the information content of implied volatility has a humped shape, with out of the money options being less informative than at the money ones. Overall, the best forecast is at the money put implied volatility: it is unbiased (after a constant adjustment) and efficient, in that it subsumes all the information contained in historical volatility.",
