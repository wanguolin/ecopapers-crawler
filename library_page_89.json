            "abstract": "This paper addresses three interesting questions. First, we explore whether price momentum exists for equities listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). Second, whether liquidity (measured by turnover ratio) enhances the momentum effect. Third, whether momentum profits exhibit reversals for illiquid stocks. Using a large sample of 3956 stocks for the period 2000 to 2021, we establish three key results. First, we find evidence of significant price momentum (intermediate and long-term) for equities listed on the BSE. Second, when conditioned on liquidity, we find that the momentum returns (short, intermediate, and long-term) are more significant for the most liquid portfolio and exhibit persistence for the next 12 months. Third, although we document evidence of short and intermediate-term reversals among the most illiquid portfolios, we fail to find evidence of persistence. Our results continue to hold after controlling for risk factors related to market premium, firm size, value, and a host of macroeconomic indicators. Taken together, our paper highlights the role of liquidity in amplifying the momentum effect in the Indian market.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Most previous studies on the market efficiency of cryptocurrencies consider time evolution but do not provide insights into the potential driving factors. This study addresses this limitation by examining the time-varying efficiency of the two largest cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum, and the factors that drive efficiency. It uses daily data from August 7, 2016, to February 15, 2023, the adjusted market inefficiency magnitude (AMIMs) measure, and quantile regression. The results show evidence of time variation in the levels of market (in)efficiency for Bitcoin and Ethereum. Interestingly, the quantile regressions indicate that global financial stress negatively affects the AMIMs measures across all quantiles. Notably, cryptocurrency liquidity positively and significantly affects AMIMs irrespective of the level of (in) efficiency, whereas the positive effect of money flow is significant when the markets of both cryptocurrencies are efficient. Finally, the COVID-19 pandemic positively and significantly affected cryptocurrency market inefficiencies across most quantiles.",

            "abstract": "Abstract This study uses high-frequency (1-min) price data to examine the connectedness among the leading cryptocurrencies (i.e. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance, Cardano, Litecoin, and Ripple) at volatility and high-order (third and fourth orders in this paper) moments based on skewness and kurtosis. The sample period is from February 10, 2020, to August 20, 2022, which captures a pandemic, wartime, cryptocurrency market crashes, and the full collapse of a stablecoin. Using a time-varying parameter vector autoregressive (TVP-VAR) connectedness approach, we find that the total dynamic connectedness throughout all realized estimators grows with the time frequency of the data. Moreover, all estimators are time dependent and affected by significant events. As an exception, the Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0093Ukraine War did not increase the total connectedness among cryptocurrencies. Analysis of third- and fourth-order moments reveals additional dynamics not captured by the second moments, highlighting the importance of analyzing higher moments when studying systematic crash and fat-tail risks in the cryptocurrency market. Additional tests show that rolling-window-based VAR models do not reveal these patterns. Regarding the directional risk transmissions, Binance was a consistent net transmitter in all three connectedness systems and it dominated the volatility connectedness network. In contrast, skewness and kurtosis connectedness networks were dominated by Litecoin and Bitcoin and Ripple were net shock receivers in all three networks. These findings are expected to serve as a guide for portfolio optimization, risk management, and policy-making practices.",

We investigate stock returns during Ramadan for 14 predominantly Muslim countries over the years 1989-2007. The results show that stock returns during Ramadan are almost nine times higher and less volatile than during the rest of the year. No discernible difference in trading volume is recorded. We find these results consistent with a notion that Ramadan positively affects investor psychology, as it promotes feelings of solidarity and social identity among Muslims world-wide, leading to optimistic beliefs that extend to investment decisions.",

This will allow us to explore whether the seasonal patterns usually found in global data; America, Australia, Europe and Asia. Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) is problematic as it leads to unreliable estimations; because of the autocorrelation and Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (ARCH) effects existence. For this reason Generalized GARCH models are estimated. Two approaches are followed. The first is the symmetric Generalized ARCH (1,1) model. However, previous studies found that volatility tends to increase more when the stock market index decreases than when the stock market index increases by the same amount. In addition there is higher seasonality in volatility rather on average returns. For this reason the Periodic-GARCH (1,1) is estimated. The findings support the persistence of the specific calendar effect in 19 out of 20 countries examined.",

The equilibrium third moment increases with the signal's skewness, and its magnitude increases with the signal's noisiness. Using institutional ownership and market capitalization as proxies for information precision, we find that both proxies are significantly and negatively correlated with the future absolute third moment in firm returns in China. We show that these relations are mainly driven by the negative third moment. The two proxies are positively correlated with future skewness, which contradicts the corresponding relations found in the US. Our model can reconcile the opposite findings if the US evidence is driven by positive skewness. This paper suggests that it is more appropriate to forecast positive and negative skewness separately when using information-precision proxies.",

A 2005 Lehman Brothers index redefinition provides a quasinatural experiment in which a number of previously high-yield split-rated bonds were mechanically relabeled as investment grade. Although their regulatory standing was unaffected, these bonds had abnormal yield declines of 21 basis points. These valuation changes can be traced to buying by asset-class-sensitive institutional investors for whom these bonds became investable.

The main research conclusions are as follows: First, the more equity overvaluation, the higher the merger premium and the short-term excess market return. Second, the more insider trading behaviour after equity overvaluation, the higher the merger premium and the short-term excess market return. Third, the greater the short-selling pressure after the equity overvaluation, the lower the merger premium and the weaker the short-term excess market return. Finally, this paper studies the economic consequences of M&A after equity overvaluation, and finds that M&A driven by equity overvaluation can only improve M&A performance in the current year, but cannot achieve long-term synergies. Based on the theory of M&A arbitrage, this paper studies the explanation mechanism of equity overvaluation to high-premium M&A in China's capital market, provides new evidence for executive's agency behaviour in M&A.

We estimate a vector autoregession to examine the joint behavior of returns, cash-flow news, and trading between individuals and institutions. Our main finding is that institutions buy shares from individuals in response to good cash-flow news, thus exploiting the underreaction phenomenon. Institutions are not simply following price momentum strategies: When price goes up in the absence of positive cash-flow news, institutions sell shares to individuals. Although institutions are trading in the 'right' direction, institutions as a group outperform individuals by only 1.44 percent per annum before transaction and other costs, because they are extremely conservative in deviating from the value-weight market index.",

            "abstract": "This paper is an investigation into the determinants of asymmetries in stock returns. We develop a series of cross-sectional regression specifications which attempt to forecast skewness in the daily returns of individual stocks. Negative skewness is most pronounced in stocks that have experienced: 1) an increase in trading volume relative to trend over the prior six months; and 2) positive returns over the prior thirty-six months. The first finding is consistent with the model of Hong and Stein (1999), which predicts that negative asymmetries are more likely to occur when there are large differences of opinion among investors. The latter finding fits with a number of theories, most notably Blanchard and Watson's (1982) rendition of stock-price bubbles. Analogous results also obtain when we attempt to forecast the skewness of the aggregate stock market, though our statistical power in this case is limited.",
