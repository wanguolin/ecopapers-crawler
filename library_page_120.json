            "abstract": "The artificial neural networks (ANN) have turned into an important tool to shape and to predict the stock returns. Due to the fact that those models incorporate nonlinear variables (characteristic of the majority of the economic and financial series) they work better than the statistical traditional models such as linear regressions or Box-Jenkins\u00e2\u0080\u0099 model. This study brings the attempt of finding regularities in the stock indexes of 27 countries by means an approximation of artificial neural networks and their contrast with linear regressive models finding evidence that reaches to the current discussion on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEfficient Market Theory\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Likewise dynamics out of sample predictions are realized sustained also by a nonparametric test confirming excellent results of the neural networks in contrast with the traditional autoregressive models.// Las redes neuronales artificiales (RNA) se han convertido en un importante instrumento para modelar y predecir los rendimientos accionarios. Debido a que son modelos que incorporan variables no lineales (caracter\u00c3\u00adstica de la mayor\u00c3\u00ada de las series econ\u00c3\u00b3micas y financieras) funcionan mejor que los modelos estad\u00c3\u00adsticos tradicionales, como las regresiones lineales o modelos Box-Jenkins. Este estudio intenta encontrar regularidades en los \u00c3\u00adndices accionarios de 27 pa\u00c3\u00adses mediante un acercamiento de redes neuronales artificiales y su contraste con modelos lineales rezagados, y aporta evidencia a la discusi\u00c3\u00b3n actual respecto a la teor\u00c3\u00ada de los mercados eficientes. Asimismo se realizan predicciones extramuestrales din\u00c3\u00a1micas sustentadas tambi\u00c3\u00a9n con una prueba no param\u00c3\u00a9trica, que confirma excelentes resultados de las redes neuronales en contraste con los modelos autorregresivos tradicionales.",

            "abstract": "This paper investigates the impact of the major US macroeconomic an- nouncements on volatility and jumps of US financial markets. Results indicate significant volatility spillover effects on the following financial markets: exchange traded funds, exchange rates, equity index futures, Treasury bonds futures, volatility indices and equity spot indices. The expected component of changes of macro variables insignificantly affect volatility. The corresponding surprise component positively and significantly affect volatility. The exchange rate market is mostly affected by macro announcements. Moreover, news related jumps are higher in magnitude than non-news-related jumps. Most of the announcements cause significant increases in jump size.",

            "abstract": "Using data from the Tokyo Stock Exchange, we study how beta, size, and ratio of book to market equity (BE/ME) account for the cross-section of expected stock returns over different lengths of investment horizons. We find that $\\beta$, adjusted for infrequent trading or not, fails to explain the cross-section of monthly expected returns, but does a much better job for horizons over half- and one-year. However, either the size or the BE/ME alone is still a significant factor in explaining the cross-section expected returns, but the size significance diminishes for longer horizons when $\\beta$ is included as an additional independent variable.",

In this paper, we investigate many anomalies in IPOs that produce huge initial return, long-term return reversal and high turnover rate from the perspective of investors' desire to gamble (skewness preferences). Based on Cumulative Prospect Theory, this paper theoretically and empirically verified that there is a significant impact on first day and long-term returns. Using all issued IPO between 2009 and 2012 as a study sample, the empirical results show that the increase of a standard deviation of skewness preference, and the first day returns increase 5.478%. Moreover, when the market environment is favorable, the positive sentiment of investors will make the effect of skewness preferences stronger. In the long run, the stronger the expected skewness is, the more negative the long-term risk premium is, and the lower the possibility of new shares that institutional investors continue to hold. In addition, skewness preferences across different industries, different financing scale, and different issue price has a significant difference.",

Moreover, the positive abnormal returns have larger absolute values and are more persistent. The return predictability of the trend in short selling is not subsumed by the level of short interest and other well-known determinants of stock returns. Investor sentiment does not affect the profitability of the trend strategy. Our results suggest that market participants underreact to public information on short interest and that short sellers are sophisticated investors.",

            "abstract": "Can systematic corporate bond investments generate attractive returns net of costs? To answer this question we apply a methodology that allows us to estimate both implicit and explicit transaction costs and thus capacity constraints in systematic long-only bond strategies. The methodology is based on Kyle and Obizhaeva (2016)\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s principle of market microstructure invariance and implies bond transaction cost functions with positive market impact estimates which is in contrast to prevailing transaction-based approaches. As the size of the bond fund increases, the market impact reduces net returns down to zero. High-turnover strategies hit capacity constraints fast. Low-turnover credit-risk-focused strategies have much higher capacities that can be further increased by constraining portfolio rebalancing in realistic ways. We find that transaction costs do not absorb the corporate bond risk premium even in the largest possible market portfolios.",

The large literature that tries to explain the first stylized fact ignores the second. This paper provides a unified theory that reconciles the two facts. I build a stationary asset pricing model of firm announcement events where firm returns display positive skewness. I then show that cross-sectional heterogeneity in firm announcement events can lead to negative skewness in aggregate returns. I provide evidence consistent with the model predictions.",

            "abstract": "We analyse 289,443 online tweets from StockTwits and construct a divergence of opinion (disagreement) indicator for investigating the impact of disagreement on stock returns and trading volume. We find that the impact of disagreement on returns is asymmetric; it is negative (positive) during bull (bear) market periods. We also find that higher online disagreement increases trading volume; this effect is detected irrespective of whether the market is bullish or bearish. Moreover, portfolio strategies that are designed on the basis of our disagreement indicator are shown to generate abnormal profits. Overall, our results confirm the important role of belief dispersion in financial markets.",

The measure is motivated by prior studies arguing that a mutual fund is skilled if it buys stocks with subsequent high earnings announcement returns. We find that this measure predicts future mutual fund returns. On average, after adjusting for Carhart\u00e2\u0080\u0099s four risk factors, the top decile of mutual funds outperforms the bottom decile by 44 basis points per quarter. By decomposing fund alphas into two components in their relations to earnings, we find that this measure is only associated with earnings-related fund alphas. This measure can also be used to predict stock returns at future earnings announcements.",

Our findings are consistent with a concave, upward-sloping maturity structure for all markets, with the largest negative premium for the shortest term maturity. The fact that both delta\u00e2\u0080\u0093vega and delta\u00e2\u0080\u0093gamma neutral straddle combinations earn positive returns that seem uncorrelated suggests that the term structure is affected by both jump risk and volatility risk.

Consistent with Ozdagli (2012), financial leverage plays a dominant role, supported by adjustment costs (which represent the degree of investment irreversibility). Specifically, the observed value premium is driven by the financial leverage differences between value and growth firms, partially neutralized by investment irreversibility. The relation between the value premium and investment irreversibility is contrary to the intuition in Zhang (2005) and Cooper (2006). Operating leverage does not significantly influence the value premium.",
