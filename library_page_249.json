            "title": "A Discourse Analysis of Tweets and Its Implications for Cryptocurrency Prices and Trade Volumes",
            "abstract": "Abstract Recent advancements in cryptography and digital assets have triggered a profound transformation, causing a reorganization of the financial sector. The growing popularity of cryptocurrencies as investment instruments has raised concerns regarding the influencer mentions on social media impact on their price dynamics. This study assesses the discourse surrounding major cryptocurrencies and tokens within the decentralized finance (DeFi) and masternode sectors, examining its influence on prices and trading volumes during the period from 2019 to 2021. The study verifies the alignment between social media communications concerning these assets and their intended objectives. The analysis utilizes KHCoder software to explore topics with the highest public engagement, revealing that DeFi users frequently exhibit herd-like behavior by actively pursuing high-return farming trends, often at the expense of unique project attributes. In contrast, discourse surrounding masternode tokens more closely adheres to project objectives. The study employs panel models and Granger causality tests to investigate the relationship between cryptocurrency market performance, interactions on social media, and tweet sentiment. The findings substantiate a causal and temporal connection between micro-discourses on Twitter and asset prices, as well as trading volumes.",

            "abstract": "Abstract We study the effect of mood-proxy variables on index returns and volatility in six South Asian markets. Our mood-proxy variables include six weather (temperature, humidity, cloud cover, air pressure, visibility, and wind speed), three weather indicator variables (fog, thunder storm and rain or drizzle) and two biorhythmic variables (SAD and lunar phases). We adopt a robust approach and attempt to select the best parsimonious econometric model for each market. Our findings suggest that mood-proxy variables have some convincing influences in South Asian capital markets. In some instances, these variables are influencing returns while in other instances they are influencing volatility.",

            "abstract": "Abstract This study revisits size effect and its associated issues, in the Indian market, as recent studies question the persistence of size premium in the global context. We use data from NIFTY 200 stocks for the period 2005 to 2018 and find size effect to be significant for both market-based and accounting-based measures of size. It is not impacted by any definitional issues as highlighted by Berk (Financ Anal J 53(5):12\u00e2\u0080\u009318, 1997). Size effect also remains significant despite alternative portfolio constructions i.e. forming quintiles, deciles, scores of portfolios even though the premiums vary. Existing literature on size anomaly does not focus on size drift and survivorship bias. We specifically address these dimensions relating to size effect which have received less attention in prior work. In this study, size effect is found to be sensitive to drift in market capitalization. Historical market capitalization used to categorize medium (large) firms may now be a basis for classifying small (medium) firms in recent time periods. Small sized portfolio adjusted for drift provides substantially higher return compared to unadjusted small sized portfolio. Further, to evaluate survivorship bias, size-based portfolios are redesigned using changing components of NIFTY 200 for each formation period. This leads to considerable weakening of size effect. Investors must take this fact into consideration while creating size based portfolios. However, upon using another stable universe of F&O traded stocks, size effect is found to be significant. The study contributes to size anomaly literature for Indian market and shall be useful for portfolio managers, investors, academia and regulators.",

            "abstract": "The legitimacy of virtual currencies as an alternative form of monetary exchange has been the centre of an ongoing heated debated since the catastrophic global financial meltdown of 2007-2008. We contribute to the relative fresh body of empirical research on the informational market efficiency of cryptomarkets by investigating the weak-form efficiency of the top-five cryptocurrencies. In differing from previous studies, we implement random walk testing procedures which are robust to asymmetries and unobserved smooth structural breaks. Moreover, our study employs two frequencies of cryptocurrency returns, one corresponding to daily returns and the other to weekly returns. Our findings validate the random walk hypothesis for daily series hence validating the weak-form efficiency for daily returns. On the other hand, weekly returns are observed to be stationary processes which is evidence against weak-form efficiency for weekly returns. Overall, our study has important implications for market participants within cryptocurrency markets.",

If the rVaR is estimated from options close-to-the-money, i.e., the 50% rVaR, stocks with high risk outperform stocks with low risk by 0.60% per month, in line with downside risk-averse investors. In contrast, if rVaR is estimated from far-out-of-the-money options, i.e., the 90% rVaR, stocks with high risk underperform stocks with low risk by 0.42% per month, implying that stocks with low risk have higher returns in the cross-section of returns. Our results are consistent with investors who prefer reliable information over unreliable information and explain contradictory results of prior studies.",

Using a bootstrapped quantile regression procedure we show a significant and robust relation between rising sentiment and price increases, and vice versa, across the distribution of bitcoin price changes. This relation is shown to be robust when controlling for a variety of exchange-specific and blockchain-wide variables. This relation is also robust when controlling for aggregate momentum across major cryptocurrencies. This finding is important as our data sample spans a period before and after the introduction of futures markets for bitcoin, which has arguably resulted in a regime shift in the time series behavior of its price. Taken together, our results show that bitcoin prices can undergo regime changes and that conventional regression-type models that focus on the center of the distribution of bitcoin price changes can yield misleading estimates.",

This is motivated by theoretical and empirical evidence in the literature which suggests that investor risk aversion negatively correlates with asset liquidity, and ample empirical evidence documenting liquidity risk premium. We use monthly US data from January 1999 to December 2018 and show that innovations in the VRP Granger-cause stock returns, which in turn drive liquidity. Our findings are consistent with predictions of prior theories and highlight the predictability of the VRP. They also contribute to the on-going debate on the causal relation between stock returns and liquidity. Finally, we explore the channels through which the VRP impacts liquidity and find that the VRP influences market and momentum factors, and that movements in these factors lead to changes in liquidity.",

Our framework thus relaxes the usual assumptions of the literature that the riskless rate is unchangingly the short period rate. A representative investor compares at each of the 3- and the 6-month horizons the risk premium offered by the market and the one they require to take a risky position, the latter premium being determined by the portfolio choice theory. Due to market frictions, the deviation between the offered and required risk premium evolves according to a mean-reverting process. Using 3-month ahead survey-based expectations of the US 3-month Treasury Bill rate, we employ Kalman filtering to estimate the market risk premium where the preference parameter of investors for alternative horizons is time-varying. We find that the market comprises both a group of agents with 3-month preferred horizon and a group of agents with 6-month preferred horizon with a weigh of two-thirds for the first group.",
