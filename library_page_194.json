            "abstract": "This paper features an analysis of the relationship between the DOW JONES Industrial Average Index (DJIA) and a sentiment news series using daily data obtained from the Thomson Reuters News Analytics (TRNA)1 provided by SIRCA (The Securities Industry Research Centre of the Asia Pacic). The recent growth in the availability of on-line financial news sources such as internet news and social media sources provides instantaneous access to financial news. Various commercial agencies have started developing their own filtered financial news feeds which are used by investors and traders to support their algorithmic trading strategies. Thomson Reuters News Analytics (TRNA)2 is one such data set. In this study we use the TRNA data set to construct a series of daily sentiment scores for Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) stock index component companies. We use these daily DJIA market sentiment scores to study the relationship between financial news sentiment scores and the stock prices of these companies using entropy measures. The entropy and Mutual Information (MI) statistics permit an analysis of the amount of information within the sentiment series, its relationship to the DJIA and an indication of how the relationship changes over time.",

            "title": "The Interdependence of FX and Treasury Bonds Markets: The Case of Colombia",
            "abstract": "We study the interdependence of FX and Treasury Bonds (TES) markets in Colombia. To do this, we estimate a heteroskedasticity identified VAR model on the returns of the COP/USD exchange rate (TRM) and bond prices, as well as event-analysis models for return volatilities, number of quotes, quote volume, and bid/ask spreads. The data under analysis consists of 5-minute intraday bid/ask US dollar prices and bond quotes, for an assortment of bond species. For these species we also have the number of bid/ask quotes as well as their volume. We found, also, that the exchange rate conveys information to the TES market, but the opposite does not completely hold: A one percent COP depreciation leads to a persistent reduction of TES prices between 0.05% and 0.22%. However, a 1% TES price increase has a very small effect and not entirely significant on the exchange rate, i.e. a COP appreciation between 0.001% and 0.009%. Furthermore, TRM return volatility increases do not affect bond return volatility but its liquidity, i.e. the bid/ask quote number and volume. These results are coherent with the fact that the FX market more efficiently reflects the effect of shocks than the TES market, which may be due to its low liquidity and concentration on a specific habitat. These results have implications for the design of financial stability policies as well as for private portfolio design, rebalancing and hedging. **** RESUMEN: Analizamos la interdependencia entre los mercados de divisas y bonos (TES) en Colombia. Para esto estimamos modelos VAR identificados por heterocedasticidad para los retornos de la tasa de cambio (TRM) y los precios de los bonos, as\u00c3\u00ad como tambi\u00c3\u00a9n modelos de an\u00c3\u00a1lisis de eventos para la volatilidad de los retornos, el n\u00c3\u00ba\u00c3\u00bamero y volumen de las ofertas, y los diferenciales de compra y venta, bid/ask spreads. Los datos analizados consisten en muestras de cada 5-minutos de precios bid/ask del d\u00c3\u00b3lar y de ofertas de los bonos, para un conjunto de referencias. Para estas referencias tambi\u00c3\u00a9n contamos con el n\u00c3\u00bamero de ofertas bid/ask as\u00c3\u00ad como su volumen. Encontramos que la TRM transmite informaci\u00c3\u00b3n al mercado de bonos, pero lo opuesto no se da completamente: una depreciaci\u00c3\u00b3n de 1% del peso produce una reducci\u00c3\u00b3n permanente del precio de los TES de entre 0.05% y 0.22%. Sin embargo, un incremento de 1% del precio de los bonos tiene un efecto peque\u00c3\u00b1o y no enteramente significativo sobre la TRM, i.e. una apreciaci\u00c3\u00b3n del peso entre 0.001% y 0.009%. Adicionalmente, los incrementos en la volatilidad de la TRM no afectan la volatilidad de los retornos de los bonos, pero si su liquidez, es decir, el n\u00c3\u00bamero y volumen de sus ofertas. Estos resultados son consistentes con el hecho de que el mercado de divisas refleja de manera m\u00c3\u00a1s eficiente el efecto de los choques que el de bonos, resultado de la baja liquidez y concentraci\u00c3\u00b3n en un h\u00c3\u00a1bitat espec\u00c3\u00adfico de este \u00c3\u00baltimo. Estos resultados tienen implicaciones importantes para el dise\u00c3\u00b1o de pol\u00c3\u00adticas de estabilidad financiera, as\u00c3\u00ad como tambi\u00c3\u00a9n para el dise\u00c3\u00b1o de portafolios privados, su rebalanceo y cobertura.",

We compare the performance, both theoretically and experimentally, of a complete network (centralized market) to incomplete networks with differing levels of connectivity (decentralized markets). We show that decentralized markets can deliver higher informational efficiency, with prices closer to fundamentals, as well as higher welfare for mean-variance investors.",

            "abstract": "Speculators can discover whether a signal is true or false by processing it but this takes time. Hence they face a trade-off between trading fast on a signal (i.e., before processing it), at the risk of trading on a false news, or trading after processing the signal, at the risk that prices already reflect their information. The number of speculators who choose to trade fast increases with news reliability and decreases with the cost of fast trading technologies. We derive testable implications for the effects of these variables on (i) the value of information, (ii) patterns in returns and trades, (iii) the frequency of price reversals in a stock, and (iv) informational efficiency. Cheaper fast trading technologies simultaneously raise informational efficiency and the frequency of ``mini-flash crashes\": large price movements that revert quickly.",

            "abstract": "I model the dynamics of price adjustments to news arrival in limit order markets when investors have limited attention. Because of limited attention, investors monitor news arrival imperfectly. Consequently prices reflect news with delay. This delay shrinks when investors' attention capacity increases. The adjustment delay also decreases when the frequency of news arrival increases. When news arrival frequency is higher, the picking-off risk increases for limit orders. The order book becomes thinner and there are fewer stale limit orders to execute or cancel following news arrival. Hence, it reduces the time it takes for market prices to reflect news content.",

            "abstract": "This paper looks into the sovereign credit default swap (CDS) market from two perspectives. First, it analyses the relation between CDS and bond spreads. The results on a single-entity basis suggest that the CDS market leads the bond market in price discovery, especially during 2010, while both markets contribute during the pre-Lehman period and in 2009. Moreover, the inclusion of the EURIBOR-EUREPO 3-month spread helps to restore the long-run relation after the Lehman bailout. An event-study, which compares the reaction of sovereign CDS and bond markets to policy announcements in Europe, suggests that both markets react in the same way, especially after the release of bad news. As for the relation between prices and volumes of sovereign CDSs, estimates do not point to any stable relation. The second perspective is the relation between CDS spreads for sovereign and corporate entities. Our estimates on an aggregate and sector-wide basis point to a leading property of the former sector, even in 2009, while the banking sector increases its leading power during 2010.",

They showed that shocks to interest rate differentials lead to carry trade activity and to significant reactions in the bilateral exchange rates vis-a-vis the US dollar that they analyse. Starting from their paper, we take a more macroeconomic standpoint and aim to identify what kind of structural shock can generate the implications of their interest rate differential shock. To this aim we add two macroeconomic variables and two indicators of confidence to the 4-variable financial VAR of Brunnermeier et al. (2009) and use sign restrictions on the impulse responses of the resulting larger VAR to identify four macroeconomic shocks. We evidence that demand shocks and confidence shocks are associated with longer-term gains from carry trade activity, relative to supply and monetary policy shocks. This finding also supports the widely reported idea that sentiment boosts position taking.",

            "abstract": "Sovereign spreads within the European Monetary Union (EMU) arise because markets price-in heterogeneous country fundamentals, but also re-denomination risks, given the incomplete nature of EMU. This creates a permanent risk of financial fragmentation within the area. In this paper we claim that political decisions that signal commitment to safeguarding the adequate functioning of the euro area influence investors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 valuations. We focus on decisions conducive to enhancing the institutional framework of the euro area (\u00e2\u0080\u009cEMU deepening\u00e2\u0080\u009d). To test our hypothesis we build a comprehensive narrative of events (decisions) from all documents and press releases issued by the Council of the EU and the European Council during the period January 2010 to March 2020. We categorize the events as dealing with: (i) economic and financial integration; (ii) fiscal policy; (iii) bailouts. With our extremely rich narrative at hand, we conduct event-study regressions with daily data to assess the impact of events on sovereign bond yields and find that indeed decisions on financial integration drive down periphery spreads. Moreover, while decisions on key subjects present a robust effect, this is not the case with prior discussions on those subjects at the Council level. Finally, we show that the impacts arise from reductions in peripheral sovereign spreads, and not by the opposite movement in core countries. We conclude that EU policy-makers have at their disposal signicant \u00e2\u0080\u009cpolitical space\u00e2\u0080\u009d to reduce fragmentation and gain \u00e2\u0080\u009cpolicy space\u00e2\u0080\u009d.",

Based on daily data, the growth of the Eurex market seems to support the tightening of the bid-ask spread of MTS Cash, all things being equal, thus confirming a healthy and efficient link between cash and futures markets. Against this backdrop, a high frequency analysis highlights some episodes of partial divergence between price developments of futures and cash markets, which might be related to differences in the microstructures of the two markets. The futures market is order driven while the cash market is quote driven; furthermore different types of participants are active in each market. At higher frequencies, episodes of unidirectional propagation of volatility shocks from BTP futures to the MTS Cash market materialize, with potential spillovers on cash market liquidity conditions. In this regard, it is also important to consider the role played by High Frequency Traders, whose activity in futures markets may well contribute to explaining the peculiarities in price dynamics highlighted by high frequency data.",

Such processes are used in the preopening period of continuous trading systems in several exchanges. It is found that the insider manipulates the market using a contrarian strategy in order to neutralize the effect of the trades of competitive informed agents. Furthermore, consistently with the empirical evidence available, we find that information revelation accelerates close to the opening, that the market price does not converge to the fundamental value no matter how many rounds the tatonnement has, and that the expected trading volume displays a U-shaped pattern. We also find that a market with a larger competitive sector (smaller insider) has an improved informational efficiency and an increased trading volume. The insider provides a public good (a lower informativeness of the price) for the competitive informed sector.",
