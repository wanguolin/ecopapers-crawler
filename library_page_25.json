            "title": "THE CORRECTNESS OF THE CAPM-MODEL APPLICATION IN THE UKRAINIAN REALITY IN TERMS OF INVESTORS FINANCIAL SECURITY",
            "abstract": "Purpose. The purpose of this article is the research of correctness of CAPM-model application in the Ukrainian stock market and the analysis of the time factor's influence on the results of this model application. This problem acquires a special relevance for the provision of the investors' financial security, who act in the conditions of significant uncertainty and high risk of the Ukrainian stock market. Methodology. In this work, methods of dynamic lines' analysis, statistical, structural, comparative, correlation-regressive analysis were used. As the initial data during the research of profitability of the Ukrainian enterprises' shares, the data of the exchanging prices of the Ukrainian emitters' securities, according to the results of the trades in the Public JSC \"Ukrainian Exchange\", were used. Results. Contemporary approaches to the CAPM-model application in the markets, which are being developed, were analysed. As the result of this analysis, it was revealed that most of the scientific researches in this area emphasize incorrectness and unreliability of the results as to the prediction of the profitability indexes on such markets. Calculation of the \u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00b2-coefficient for the Ukrainian emitters' securities for the various investments' horizon periods was done. The results of the calculation showed that the value of the \u00c3\u008e\u00c2\u00b2-coefficient varies greatly onthe terms of investment and is not of the strictly consistent pattern. Stock market profitability per month based on UX-index and considering the investment horizon period was calculated. The expected profitability of the Ukrainian emitters' securities was distinguished and compared to their real rate of returns. During the profitability analysis in the investment intervals, exponential moving average with its further shift for a month was used. It gave an opportunity to distinguish an average monthly profitability in the various investment horizon periods (1 till 12 months). Practical significance. The application of the suggested approach can become an additional technique for the estimation of the investment attractiveness of securities of the stock market emitters in the various investment horizon periods that, in its turn, will increase the safety of such investment. Conclusions. The conclusion was made as to the correctness of the CAPM-model application in the Ukrainian reality, according to which it is almost impossible to define the exact regularity of the behaviour of indexes of the expected and real profitability depending on the investment horizon period. It casts doubt on the possibility of the appropriate and correct application of the CAPMmodel in the Ukrainian stock market. This conclusion, in general, coincides with the conclusions of many scientists, who conducted similar researches in the stock markets of other developing countries.",

Positive (good) information flows are assumed to increase the price of a financial vehicle while negative (bad) information flows decrease the price. For the majority of a sample of ten split-stocks it is shown that the proposed decomposition explains more GARCH than volume itself. Using the proposed decomposition, the variance of returns for younger split stocks reacts asymmetrically to good news flowing into the market, while the variance for older split-stocks reacts symmetrically to good news and bad news.",

            "abstract": "The aim of this paper is to study the impact of Romanian Financial Supervisory Authority (FSA) decision number 23, which was taken on the 5th February of, 2014. This decision canceled the measure number 11 from August 12th, 2005, through which an investment fund cannot buy other investment fund\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stocks. By applying the new FSA decision, each investment fund, namely SIF 1 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Banat Crisana, SIF 2 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Moldova, SIF 3 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Transilvania, SIF 4 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Muntenia, and SIF 5 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Oltenia can buy stocks from each other. Our results show that the stocks return of the five investment funds, reacted significantly in the first day after the event, when a significant positive increase of 4.69% in the average return was recorded. Moreover, it seems that after 5 days the stock return of SIF3 has the tendency to return to pre-event values.",

            "abstract": "This study investigates stock price performance at the industry level during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Greece. The analysis distinguishes between five periods from January to May 2020, namely the pre-incubation, incubation, outbreak, lockdown, and lockdown lift periods. The study provides evidence that industry-level stock returns witnessed their largest drop during the outbreak period. In particular, the travel and leisure, construction, telecommunications, industrial goods, real estate, technology and utility sectors had, on average, highly negative cumulative returns. The results also reveal a partial recovery in equity prices during the lockdown period, possibly due to the announcement of fiscal stimulus measures by the Greek government, along with the initiation of the ECB\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP). The telecommunications, construction, technology, and travel and leisure sectors exhibited the highest performance over that period. The study also evaluates the reaction of industry-level stock returns relative to the market index, performing an event study analysis. The empirical findings show that the utilities, telecommunications, personal goods and retail sectors experienced fewer losses compared with the market index during the outbreak period in Greece. Finally, despite the partial recovery of equity prices in the lockdown period, the results show that the basic raw materials, food and beverage, industrial goods and retail sectors underperformed compared with the market index in the short run.",

The price response persists for several days, during which analysts revise their forecasts about the firm cash flows. Selected politician tweets linked to legislation affect the stock prices of firms in the same industry as the targeted firm. The timeline of politician viewpoints within a particular bill exhibits surges in relevant news that predict roll call votes months before the signing of the bill.

We combine investor behavioral traits and option-implied standard deviations under both the real-world probabaility valued most in the view of the uninformed investors and the risk-neutral space adopted when there exists no cognitive error. Given that investor sentiment can be thought of as risk taking by the uniformed exceeding their informed peers, we postulate that the differences between variance, skewness and kurtosis mesures for investors with various behavioral traits.We hence construct our investor sentiment proxy by summing these differentials of variance, skewness and kurtosis in weighted forms. It is documented that such relative investor sentiment metric exhibits economically and statistically strong return predictability for momentum porfolios. Our findings contribute to the extant literature by 1) complementing the Baker-Wurgler market-based investor sentiment index from a theoretical perspective 2) modelling investor sentiment via utilizing the informational content of options prices and 3) supporting the Barberis-Schleifer-Vishny definition of investor sentiment to be differences in financial market participant behavior.",

We estimate the model using data on bond yields and individual survey responses from the Survey of Professional Forecasters and perform a novel three-way decomposition of bond yields into (i) average expectations about short rates (ii) risk premia and (iii) a speculative component due to heterogeneous expectations about the resale value of a bond. We prove that the speculative term must be orthogonal to public information in real time and therefore statistically distinct from risk premia. Empirically, the speculative component is quantitatively important, accounting for up to one percentage point of US yields. Furthermore, estimates of historical risk premia from the heterogeneous information model are less volatile than, and negatively correlated with, risk premia estimated using a standard Affine Gaussian Term Structure model.",

If traders are heterogeneous, they may consist of \u00e2\u0080\u0098fundamentalists\u00e2\u0080\u0099 who correctly forecast the future spot rate changes, and \u00e2\u0080\u0098chartists\u00e2\u0080\u0099 who use a different information set and pay attention to past exchange rate changes. In this case, the coefficient on the forward premium will deviate from its theoretical value, and will converge to one only if past spot rates are taken into account for the calculation of exchange rate changes and forward premia. The magnitude of the deviation and the speed of convergence are found to depend both on the proportion of each type of traders in the market and on the memory length of \u00e2\u0080\u0098chartists\u00e2\u0080\u0099.
