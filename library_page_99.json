            "abstract": "This paper examines the impact of naked short selling on equity markets where it is restricted to securities on an approved list. Consistent with Miller's (1977) intuition, stocks with the highest dispersion of opinions and short sale constraints are the only stocks to exhibit significant and negative abnormal returns in the post-event period. We also find slightly higher stock return volatility and a small reduction in liquidity when naked short sales are allowed. Overall, it impairs market quality (liquidity and volatility), although there appears to be some improvement in price efficiency in stocks with high short sale constraints.",

In addition, investor attention is related to the currency risk premium. Our results suggest that investor attention is a priced source of risk in FX markets.",

            "abstract": "In the last decade, the efficient market hypothesis and its validity for emerging markets grew as a fertile topic of debate in Finance. However, the dilemma of market efficiency still remains intractable. It is more likely that any literature review in respect of market efficiency would produce contradictory results: for a single paper producing empirical evidence supporting the market efficiency, we can perhaps find a contradictory paper which empirically establishes market inefficiency. Paradoxically, popular models in finance developed in 1970s or 1980s were based on the assumption that the market under consideration was efficient. The conventional bond or stock or option pricing models are common examples of this type. In an alternative approach, we have worked out a model which incorporates market sentiments in the domain of the standard rational model of asset pricing. Our model would be well applicable for a \u00e2\u0080\u0098less than\u00e2\u0080\u0099 efficient market and, therefore may be the useful input in investors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 policies.",

            "abstract": "This paper is concerned with empirical and theoretical basis of the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH). The paper begins with an overview of the statistical properties of asset returns at different frequencies (daily, weekly and monthly), and considers the evidence on return predictability, risk aversion and market efficiency. The paper then focuses on the theoretical foundation of the EMH, and show that market efficiency could co-exit with heterogeneous beliefs and individual irrationality so long as individual errors are cross sectionally weakly dependent in the sense defined by Chudik, Pesaran, and Tosetti (2010). But at times of market euphoria or gloom these individual errors are likely to become cross sectionally strongly dependent and the collective outcome could display significant departures from market efficiency. Market efficiency could be the norm, but it is likely to be punctuated with episodes of bubbles and crashes. The paper also considers if market inefficiencies (assuming that they exist) can be exploited for profit.",

Various measures have been developed in the literature without being to determine which measure should be used. The purpose of this study is to test their relative performance in predicting stock returns. Using a panel of investor sentiment measures, we develop a new measure of sentiment which combines direct and indirect sentiment measures. Our results show that our composite sentiment index affects the returns of stocks hard to value and difficult to arbitrage consistent with the predictions of noise trader\u00e2\u0080\u0099s models. Finally, we find that our composite index has a better predictive ability than the alternative sentiment measures largely used in the literature.",

Empirically, many anomaly variables are associated with future investment growth, in the same direction with future returns.
