            "abstract": "We generalize the Homm and Breitung (2012) CUSUM-based procedure for the real-time detection of explosive autoregressive episodes in financial price data to allow for time-varying volatility. Such behavior can heavily inflate the false positive rate (FPR) of the CUSUM-based procedure to spuriously signal the presence of an explosive episode. Our modified procedure involves replacing the standard variance estimate in the CUSUM statistics with a nonparametric kernel-based spot variance estimate. We show that the sequence of modified CUSUM statistics has a joint limiting null distribution which is invariant to any time-varying volatility present in the innovations and that this delivers a real-time monitoring procedure whose theoretical FPR is controlled. Simulations show that the modification is effective in controlling the empirical FPR of the procedure, yet sacrifices only a small amount of power to detect explosive episodes, relative to the standard procedure, when the shocks are homoskedastic. An empirical illustration using Bitcoin price data is provided.",

            "abstract": "By introducing a genetic algorithm learning with a classifier system into a limit order market, this paper provides a unified framework of microstructure and agent-based models of limit order markets that allows traders to determine their order submission endogenously according to market conditions. It examines how traders process and learn from market information and how the learning affects limit order markets. It is found that, measured by the average usage of different group of market information, trading rules under the learning become stationary in the long run. Also informed traders pay more attention to the last transaction sign while uninformed traders pay more attention to technical rules. Learning of uninformed traders improves market information efficiency, but not necessarily when informed traders learn. Opposite to the learning of informed traders, learning makes uninformed traders submit less aggressive limit orders and more market orders. Furthermore private values can have significant impact in the short run, but not in the long run. One implication is that the probability of informed trading (PIN) is positively related to the volatility and the bid-ask spread.",

            "abstract": "The growing concern about the natural environment is getting relevance not only on institutional investors but also on individual ones. However, these retail investors face some difficulties, such as the fact that they are often not able to monitor many assets but they are also unable to use most of the methodology proposed in the empirical evidence because it is not feasible for them. We avoid these problems by proposing an investment strategy based on the different values of the alpha and beta coefficients from the Fama-French and Carhart models. We use Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) which track companies involved on clean and renewable energy businesses and it is provided evidence that in most of the cases the best investment strategy is to follow the positive and significant values of the alphas from the estimated models and to hold the portfolio for a short period of time. Additionally, we also report that the signals from the coefficients associated to the value factor (HML) must not be undervalued. Finally, we demonstrate that wind, clean energy and solar energy sectors are the most important renewable energies for investors. These findings reinforce the importance of investing on renewable companies using ETFs.",

Our results show significant time-variation in the response of the global equity markets to U.S. monetary policy surprises, where an unanticipated interest rate cut leads to an increase in stock returns. Our findings suggest that the foreign stock markets respond more to U.S. monetary policy surprises during the crisis periods.

            "abstract": "The disposition effect is a longstanding puzzle in financial economics. This paper demonstrates that it is not intrinsically at odds with rational behavior. In a rational expectations model with asymmetrically informed investors, trading strategies as predicted by the disposition effect can arise as an optimal response to dynamic changes in the information structure. The model predicts that the disposition behavior of uninformed investors weakens after events that reduce information asymmetries. The data, trading records of 50,000 clients at a German discount brokerage firm from 1995 to 2000, are consistent with this prediction.",

During times of recession, stock returns are explained differently for past losers and winners; the level of credit quality dominates the return dynamics for extreme losers, while levels of information-based trading activity and information ambiguity contribute to winners\u00e2\u0080\u0099 medium-term returns. Such asymmetry is proposed as the source of insignificant profits achieved using conventional momentum strategies. On the other hand, in times of expansion, conventional asset pricing factors are found to affect stock returns with a dependence on the level of credit quality; this suggests that more profitable momentum strategies remain to be discovered.",

More than two decades of official daily data on intervention in the JPY/USD market facilitate our analysis. We find no evidence that small interventions exert a discernible influence on the exchange rate while large interventions significantly influence the exchange rate in the theoretically consistent manner. We conclude that small interventions may not be considered a determinant of the exchange rate while large interventions constitute an important element in our understanding, and modeling, of the exchange rate.",

This paper uses high-frequency intra-day data over a three-year period to investigate the impact of regularly scheduled macroeconomic news and monetary policy announcements on the returns of the Italian government bond market, the largest one in the Euro-zone. With respect to the previous papers, we use a much broader set of announcements, 68, and a relatively novel dataset (MTS). We find that 25 news have a significant impact on bond returns and that almost all announcements are incorporated into prices within 20min from the release.",

By ranking companies on their firm-specific equity return, instead of their total equity return, the default risk exposures halve, the Sharpe ratio doubles and the drawdowns are substantially reduced.",

If arbitrageurs find it more difficult to correct the mispricing of stocks with high idiosyncratic risk, there should be a positive (negative) relation between expected return and idiosyncratic risk for undervalued (overvalued) stocks. We combine several well-known anomalies to measure stock mispricing and proxy stock idiosyncratic risk using an exponential GARCH model for stock returns. We confirm that average stock returns monotonically increase (decrease) with idiosyncratic risk for undervalued (overvalued) stocks. Overall, our results support the importance of idiosyncratic risk as an arbitrage cost.",
