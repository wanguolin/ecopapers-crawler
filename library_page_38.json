            "abstract": "We revisit the stock market anomaly documented by Thomas and Zhang (2008) and show that the apparent mispricing of information transfers has decayed over time, as the US markets experienced rapid improvements in the efficiency of the underlying price formation processes. Utilizing recent advancements in market microstructure research to estimate firm-specific proxies for market efficiency, we demonstrate that the existence of the overreaction anomaly (where stock prices of late announcers in response to the earnings reported by early announcers in the same industry are negatively related to subsequent price responses of late announcers to their own earnings reports) is specific to an earlier sample period and results from the inefficient incorporation of information into prices, largely attributable to an environment with high barriers to arbitrage. Our results indicate that the pricing efficiency of intra-industry information transfers has increased in the recent years of increased liquidity and markedly higher trading activity.",

            "abstract": "Are anomalies strongest when investor sentiment or limits of arbitrage are considered to be greatest? We empirically explore these theoretically deducted predictions. We first identify, categorize, and replicate 100 long-short anomalies in the cross-section of expected equity returns. We then comprehensively study their interaction with popular proxies for time-varying market-level sentiment and arbitrage conditions. We find a powerful (relatively weak) role of the variation in proxies for sentiment (arbitrage constraints). In this context, the predictive power of sentiment is mostly restricted to the short leg of strategy returns. Our insights collectively suggest that the dynamics of sentiment combined with the base level (and not primarily the variations) of limits to arbitrage provide at least a partial explanation for inefficiencies.",

            "abstract": "The Fama and Frenchs three factor model (Fama and French, 1992, 1993) is now the most popular replacement for CAPM. In the model, the fact that the model excludes financial firms is significant because financial firms are a large fraction of the value of the U.S. stock market. Also, there is no theoretical reason for excluding financial firms. Modigliani and Miller (1958, 1963) suggest that leverage affects beta, but it does not invalidate the capital asset pricing model. It would therefore be more satisfying if the pricing model applied generally, rather than being restricted to non-financial corporations. Thus, we assess the validity of size and value risk as common risk factors to measure of the cross-section of expected stock returns in financial companies. Empirical asset pricing tests suggest two findings. First, size and value risk premia commonly exists in both nonfinancial and financial firms, even if two factors are less explicable in financial firms. Second, an interest rate risk premium (\u00ce\u0094L/L) which defined as a financial firm specific risk factor only appears in financial companies.",

            "abstract": "This paper examines profitable trading strategies that jointly exploit momentum and reversal signals in commodity futures. While the single-sort momentum strategies returns 11.14% per annum, on average, a consistent reversal pattern of momentum profits is pronounced from 12 to 30months after portfolio formation. Combining the observed reversal pattern with the momentum signal, our double-sort strategy returns 20.24% per annum, which significantly outperforms single-sort strategies. The proposed strategy is robust to seasonality effects and sample adjustments in commodity futures. The profitability of the double-sort strategy cannot be explained by standard risk factors, term structure, market volatility, investor sentiment, data-mining or transaction costs, but appears to be related to global funding liquidity. As a consequence, the double-sort strategy in commodity futures may be employed as a portfolio diversification tool.",

            "abstract": "We provide evidence that a simple moving average timing strategy, when applied to portfolios of commodity futures, can generate superior performance to the buy-and-hold strategy. The outperformance is very robust. It can survive the transaction costs in the futures markets, it is not concentrated in a particular subperiod, and is robust to short-sale constraints, alternative specifications of the moving average lag length, alternative construction of the continuous time-series of futures prices, and impact from data mining. The outperformance of the timing strategy is not driven by the backwardation and contango. It is stronger during recession and can not be explained by macroeconomic variables. Finally, we confirm that the outperformance of the moving average timing strategy in the commodity futures comes from the successful market timing.",

The classical event study methodology attempts to make explicit this link by assuming rigid and universal pre-event, event, and post-event periods. As an alternative, our framework captures the progressive diffusion of information around events as well as the overlapping impacts of separate events. We also illustrate that our approach captures mean-reversion of expected returns and increased volatility around announcement dates. These features reflect latent regime switches and are associated with semi-strong market efficiency.",

            "abstract": "Based on individual CDS transactions cleared by the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, we show that illiquidity strongly affects credit default swap premiums. We identify the following effects: first, transaction direction affects prices, as buy (sell) orders lead to premium increases (decreases). Second, larger transactions have a higher price impact. This finding stands in stark contrast to corporate bond markets. Third, traders charge higher premiums as a price for liquidity provision, not as compensation for asymmetric information. Fourth, buy-side investors pay significantly higher prices than dealers for demanding liquidity. Finally, inventory risk seems to matter little in explaining liquidity premiums.",

We combine mean\u00e2\u0080\u0093variance analysis with conditional Value-at-Risk using the subadditivity property of conditional Value-at-Risk, and we introduce a two stage method that preserves diversification while controlling for large losses.

We find substantial differences for all levels of aggregation: trade classification, order imbalance, VPIN and identifying \u00e2\u0080\u009ctoxic periods\u00e2\u0080\u009d.
