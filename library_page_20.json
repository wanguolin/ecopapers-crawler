            "title": "Liquidity Estimates and Selection Bias",
            "abstract": "Since traders often employ price-dependent strategies and cancel expensive orders, conventional estimates tend to overestimate available liquidity. This paper studies trading costs using the sample of portfolio transition trades. The known exogeneity of these trades eliminates the selection bias problem. We estimate a piece-wise linear price impact functions with the intercept corresponding to fixed spread costs and the slope corresponding to variable price impact costs. Buy orders are more expensive than sell orders due to specific institutional features of portfolio transitions. For high-volume stocks, small trades are executed at a discount relative to a piece-wise linear specification. Since the size of this discount is comparable to bid-ask spread, we attribute documented non-linearity to ability of portfolio transition managers sometimes to earn bid-ask spread instead of paying it by providing liquidity to other market participants.",

Specifically, it explains their equity performance at the time of the first industry announcement and then again after their own earnings announcement. These results provide novel insights into how earnings announcements contain both firm specific as well as industry information that is value relevant for investors.",

            "abstract": "This paper contributes to the discussion on the efficiency of newly emerged financial markets in transition economies. We use data on one of the most developed financial markets in transition, the Czech Republic, to investigate financial market efficiency by examining the reaction to macroeconomic releases. Direct measure of market expectations, that is, survey data, is used to form a proxy for market expectations. The reactions of interest rates, bond yields, exchange rates, and the stock market index are explored. We found that, despite the fact that the survey data appear to reasonably approximate rational expectations, the Czech market lacks basic efficiency properties. It reacts to the expected part of the news announcement, and the adjustment is stretched over a period of several days. In the case of CPI, we found evidence suggesting that the efficiency of the market improves over time.",

Using data on CDS spreads, we examine which of these different types of rating announcements contains pricingrelevant information. We find that all types, including changes in outlook, have a significant impact on CDS spreads. Even rating announcements preceded by similar announcements have an impact. The price impact is greatest for firms with split ratings, smallcap firms and firms rated near the threshold of investment grade.",

            "abstract": "This paper provides a critical evaluation of a widely made argument that stock prices in markets with lower return R2 are more efficient. We show that in a standard rational expectations model, return R2 is independent of the amount of information incorporated into stock prices. Furthermore, an alternative model in which stock price fluctuations are driven by investor sentiment leads to an opposite prediction that lower return R2 is associated with stronger medium-term price momentum and long-term price reversal, two commonly believed signs of market inefficiency. By examining stock returns both in the U.S. and internationally, we found empirical evidence consistent with this contrasting prediction. Overall, our analysis casts doubt on the argument that low return R2 is a measure of market efficiency.",

            "abstract": "We explore performance persistence in mutual funds using absolute and relative benchmarks. Our sample, largely free of survivorship bias, indicates that relative risk-adjusted performance of mutual funds persists, however persistence is mostly due to funds that lag the S&P 500. A profit analysis indicates that poor performance increases the probability of disappearance. A year-by-year decomposition of the persistence effect demonstrates that the relative performance pattern depends upon the time period observed, and it is correlated across managers. Consequently, it is due to a common strategy that is not captured by standard stylistic categories, or risk adjustment procedures.",

Along with more traditional methods of using cross correlations, partial correlation and Toda-Yamamoto causality tests, we also analysed the speed of adjustment of assets to their intrinsic values and identified the most prevalent lag using rolling time windows. The analysis was performed using data from the South Africa capital market.",

The informed trader has private information regarding arbitrary higher moments of asset return, such as volatility or skewness, and exploits her private information by trading a complete menu of options. The equilibrium trading strategies of the informed agent in our model reflect those used by traders in the market when trying to exploit higher order moment information, such as the volatility straddle.",

            "abstract": "The informative value given by the announcement of distribution of dividend has already been investigated. One of the leading studies on this matter is Lintner (1956). Lintner found a relation between mutation in dividend, profits in the current financial year and the dividend in the last financial year. This dividend-model is known as the Lintner-model. When the mutation in the dividend differs from what was to be expected by this dividend-model, Lintner finds this to have informative value regarding the amount of profit in the future. In 197 1 I/B/E/S International started a financial data-file, The Institutional Brokers Estimate System (I/B/E/S). This data-file contains the expectations of the analysts regarding profit. Since 1989 I/B/E/S is collecting this data also for Dutch firms. In this article an extra variable is added to the Lintner-model, namely the expectations collected by I/B/E/S mentioned above. The purpose of this article is to find out if there is still informative value regarding the amount of profit in the future when the mutation in the dividend differs from what was to be expected by this adjusted Lintner-model.",

            "abstract": "Using a comprehensive sample of trades from Schedule 13D filings by activist investors, we study how measures of adverse selection respond to informed trading. We find that on days when activists accumulate shares, measures of adverse selection and of stock illiquidity are lower, even though prices are positively impacted. Two channels help explain this phenomenon: (a) activists select times of higher liquidity when they trade, and (b) activists use limit orders. We conclude that when informed traders can select when and how to trade, standard measures of adverse selection may fail to capture the presence of informed trading.",

Validated using RepRisk and Refinitiv metrics, the model effectively identifies inconsistencies between corporate climate commitments and actions as they emerge. We document significant negative market reactions to these controversies: firms experience an immediate average stock price drop of 0.68%, with further declines over subsequent weeks. The impact is intensified by high media visibility and is notably stronger for firms with existing emission reduction commitments, underscoring the market's penalty for perceived environmental failures.",
