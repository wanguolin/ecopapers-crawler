The event study methodology is used with two different methodologies and three abnormal return computational methods to improve the robustness and reliability of the results. This study evidences significant reversals following both large price declines and increases up to six months. Further, stronger initial shocks were followed by stronger reversals. The results are consistent with the \u00e2\u0080\u0098overreaction hypothesis\u00e2\u0080\u0099 in the Indian stock market. The results are robust to microstructure effects, extreme events, industry, period, methodology and market effects. The abnormal returns following large price declines might be economically significant with potential economic profits for traders.",

These events tend to be associated with large positive returns in the period when the events are predicted to occur (without conditioning on the outcome or existence of the event itself). These returns occur mainly on the long side of the portfolio, are statistically and economically large when value weighted, and replicate internationally. It is difficult to explain the observed patterns with a unified risk theory. Some of the underlying causes seem to be related to idiosyncratic risk, predictable attention, probability mistakes, and demand for corporate distributions.",

Measurable effects of announcements arise with a one-day delay meaning that government bond markets take some time to react to ECB announcements. The country-specific extent of yield reduction seems inversely related to the solvency rating of the corresponding countries. The spread between core and periphery countries reduces because of a stronger decrease in the latter. This result is confirmed by letting the announcement variable interact with the current spread level.",

            "abstract": "The dividend announcement of a company is an informational event that can cause underreaction, momentum, overreaction, post-dividend announcement drift, and mean reversion. It is the uncertainty surrounding dividend announcements that leads to such behavioural phenomena. Most authors consider that underreaction occurs after dividend shocks because new information about the dividend is being slowly and gradually built into the stock price. The effect of dividend shocks is often reflected in excess returns, which can last up to one year after the shock. The experiment described in this paper tests whether statistically significant excess returns are realized after a shock dividend announcement. Participants trade with the stocks of two companies, which only differ by dividend-generating stochastic process. The dividend process of Company 2 is a Merton-style jump-diffusion process (consisting of two parts: Brownian motion and Poisson jump), while the dividend process of Company 1 contains only the Brownian motion component. Statistically significant excess returns are expected when trading with Company 2 stocks. An autoregressive model is applied in order to test this hypothesis. The conclusion is that a dividend shock is followed by statistically significant excess returns in 20 of the 22 experiments, which implies that markets are inefficient after sudden and large changes in dividends. Underreaction and discount rate effects are identified.",

The inquiry is guided by multidisciplinary behavioural-related theories. The analyses employed a long span of Bursa Malaysia stock market data from 1977 to 2014 along the different phases of economic development and market states. The tests confirmed the presence of asymmetric dynamic behaviour of prices predictability as well as risk and return relationships across different market states, risk states and quantiles data segments. The efficiency tests show trends of an adaptive pattern of weak market efficiency across various economic phases and market states. Collectively, these evidences lend support to bounded-adaptive rational of investors' behaviour, dynamic stock price behaviour, and accordingly forming bounded-adaptive market efficiency.",

Employing a survey and ordinal regression models, the findings demonstrate that investment characteristics such as active trading, usage of internet and telephone, and saving for retirement objective are likely to improve diversification, whereas diversification worsens with the spending less time on researching investment. With respect to stock's characteristics, trading volume and return on asset are related to better diversification, whereas profit margin and return on equity are related to least diversification.

A firm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s global sourcing strategy serves as an option to hedge its value against trade shocks. Higher output tariffs increase firm value through reduced import competition, whereas higher input tariffs decrease firm value through higher input costs. The negative effects of input tariffs are more substantial for firms more reliant on foreign suppliers. We test the theoretical predictions in the context of the US-China trade war and quantify the impact of trade protectionism on Chinese firm value. One standard deviation increase of input tariff reduces the daily stock return by 0.12 percent for firms importing inputs, more than offsetting the gains from raising output tariffs by one standard deviation. The negative effect of input tariffs is larger for firms with high import intensity and low import substitutability. The welfare loss of the Chinese retaliatory tariffs was as much as $5.50 billion, 0.81% of the total value added of Chinese listed firms.",

            "abstract": "The Federal Reserve\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quantitative easing (QE) program has been accompanied by a flow of funds into emerging-market economies (EMEs) in search of higher returns. When Federal Reserve officials first mentioned an eventual slowdown and end of purchases under the central bank\u00e2\u0080\u0099s QE program in May and June 2013, foreign investors started to withdraw some of these funds, leading to capital outflows, a drop in EME currencies and stock markets, and a rise in bond yields. Using an event-study approach, this paper estimates the impact of \u00e2\u0080\u009cFed tapering\u00e2\u0080\u009d on EME financial markets and capital flows for 19 EMEs. Results suggest that EMEs with strong fundamentals (e.g., stronger growth and current account position, lower debt, and higher growth in business confidence and productivity), saw more favourable responses to Fed communications on tapering. Capital account openness initially played a role as well, but diminished in importance in subsequent tapering announcements.",

            "abstract": "This paper advances the literature on the dynamics of the U.S. Dollar-Mexican Peso (USD/MXN) volatility process by leveraging high-frequency data. First, it documents the factors that characterize the intraday volatility process of the USD/MXN exchange rate at high frequencies based on a sample of five-minute returns from 2008 to 2017. Second, it empirically identifies the effects and the relative impact on the USD/MXN volatility process of various macroeconomic announcements, at different frequencies. The results conclude that the most impactful releases are associated with the monetary policy announcements by the Federal Reserve and Banco de M\u00c3\u00a9xico, together with the publication of some U.S. and China macroeconomic data. Furthermore, the results suggest that the different mechanisms implemented by Mexico's FX Commission have accomplished their objective of stabilizing the volatility of the USD/MXN.",

            "abstract": "The purpose of this paper is to reconsider the empirical evidence on the relation between inflation, inflation uncertainty, and stock returns. Two unprecedented proxies for inflation uncertainty are used. First, the power of inflation and inflation uncertainty to explain stock returns is compared. Both variables are separately negatively related to stock returns. However, when both are included together in the regressions, the inflation variable becomes redundant, meaning that its coefficient becomes statistically insignificantly different from zero. This means that inflation uncertainty dominates and supplants the effect of inflation. Second, this paper provides strong evidence that inflation uncertainty itself becomes redundant, and fails to explain stock returns, when two fundamental variables are included in the regressions. The two fundamental variables are the change in the cost of equity, and the growth rate of earnings. The first variable is roughly measured by the change in the baa and in the aaa corporate bond yields, while the second one is taken to be the rate of change of industrial production. The main conclusion of the paper is that both inflation and inflation uncertainty are not significantly related to stock returns when the two aforementioned fundamental variables are accounted for.",
