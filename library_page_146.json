            "title": "Effect of Stock Price Information on Timing of Share Repurchases",
            "abstract": "Objective \u00c3\u00af\u00c2\u00bf\u00c2\u00bd This study investigates whether private information newly incorporated into stock price enhances performance in timing share repurchases. Methodology/Technique \u00c3\u00af\u00c2\u00bf\u00c2\u00bd Cost saving gained in share repurchases is used a proxy for performance of market-timing in share repurchases and firm-specific stock return variation is used to gauge stock price informativeness. A sample of 334 U.S. repurchasing firms are tested using panel data regression. Findings \u00c3\u00af\u00c2\u00bf\u00c2\u00bd The paper concludes that managers possess better market timing skill by obtaining more cost saving from their share repurchases when private information is reflected in stock price. Stock price informativeness may be the tool for managers to improve their market timing skill to take advantage of the stock market. Furthermore, firms with smaller size and a higher market-to-book ratios, and firms with higher cash-to-assets ratios are found to achieve more cost saving in buying back their shares indicating that these firms are able to time the market in share repurchasing. Novelty \u00c3\u00af\u00c2\u00bf\u00c2\u00bd Despite numerous previous studies focusing solely on using share repurchases announcement for computing cumulative abnormal returns in testing managerial market timing, this study contributes to the literature in several ways: (i) providing evidence relating stock price informativeness and performance of market-timing in share repurchases; (ii) developing a better timing measure constructed using actual repurchasing data; (iii) adopting a cost saving measure as the timing measure instead of cumulative abnormal return. Type of Paper: Empirical.",

            "title": "Price discovery or noise: The role of arbitrage and speculation in explaining crude oil price behaviour",
            "abstract": "This article presents a model for the determination of crude oil futures price that focuses on the activities of arbitragers and speculators. Arbitragers, who exploit cost of carry deviations, rely (in part) on commodity convenience yield to identify mispriced futures contracts. However, an important impediment to this process is obtaining timely information regarding marginal convenience yield as crude oil inventory changes. This study employs an unconventional measure of convenience yield that allows for inferring inventory changes directly from spot and futures prices of the commodity. The model is tested for three and six month West Texas Intermediate futures contracts. The results show a decline in the effectiveness of arbitrage activity during the sharp rise and fall in crude oil prices in 2008. Over the same period, it is found that speculation played a greater role in the determination of crude oil prices.",

            "abstract": "This study examines price-volume relation in crude palm oil (CPO) futures market during the pre-crisis, crisis and post-crisis periods. Based on daily data from January 2000 to July 2017, cross-correlation function (CCF) provides four findings: First, volatilities of past trading volume and current return are correlated in pre- and post-crisis with an inconsistent sign, supporting the nature of noise trader demand. Second, in the pre-crisis period, both volatilities are negatively correlated within a short time span. Third, during the crisis period, there is no volatility spillover between both series. Fourth, in the post-crisis period, both volatilities of past trading volume and current return are positively correlated within a long time span, in addition to volatility spillover from the current return to the future trading volume which also happens within a short time span. Notably, significant volatility spillovers from trading volume to return across the crisis change the sign of correlations with a longer time span, supporting the \u00e2\u0080\u009cheterogeneity of traders\u00e2\u0080\u009d hypothesis. This study suggests that market participants have become risk-averse, particularly after the crisis. As a result, there has been an increase in volatility persistence which reduces the level of informational efficiency.",

            "abstract": "In electronic, liquid markets traders frequently change their positions. We posit that the asymmetry in the distribution of these position changes carries important information about portfolio demand in the market. We use skewness to capture the asymmetry in position changes and from this distribution, we construct a market-wide measure for portfolio demand. Using a rich regulatory data set on S&P 500 E-mini futures, we show that this portfolio demand measure has a positive impact on prices. Decomposing our measure of portfolio demand into aggressive, passive and mixed components, we show that a one standard deviation increase in passive liquidity demand is associated with a 0.5 tick rise in prices for S&P 500 E-mini futures. Finally, we show that the distribution of position changes is crucial for explaining the execution cost of large traders.",

            "abstract": "The present paper aims at revisiting the information transmission between cryptocurrency markets and investor attention in these assets. For this purpose, we use transfer entropy rather than the conventional Granger causality approach. The resort to transfer entropy is an interesting route to overcome the limitations of Granger\u00e2\u0080\u0099s concept of causality related to the linearity (and Gaussianity) assumption. In addition, a non-gaussian factor model is estimated to extract a proxy of investor attention from Google search volumes of a set of keywords. Whilst empirical studies commonly report a one-way causal effect between investor attention and price movements, our results shed light on a bidirectional spillover which can be attributed to the self-sustaining nature of price dynamics in speculative markets.",

Using customers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 opinions on over 1200 brands, we find that stocks of companies with prestigious brands have high market-to-book ratios and large negative loadings on the Fama-French HML factor. This relation is not explained by distress risk, asset irreversibility/growth, or information asymmetry. The HML loadings are most pronounced when retail investor ownership is high (when institutional ownership is low), when the brand is less familiar, and when market-wide investor sentiment is high. We conclude glamour in the product market is an important component of glamour in the stock market.",

In this paper, we hypothesize that while market participants generally underreact to new events due to conservatism, the extent of underreaction is moderated by \u00e2\u0080\u009csurprise,\u00e2\u0080\u009d thus causing market participants to overreact to events that are highly surprising.

In particular, we focus on whether liquidity effects are more pronounced in periods of financial crises, especially for bonds with high credit risk, using a unique data set covering more than 20,000 bonds, between October 2004 and December 2008.

We document substantial return predictability from the set of easy-to-analyze firms to their more complicated peers. Specifically, a simple portfolio strategy that takes advantage of this straightforward vs. complicated information processing classification yields returns of 118 basis points per month before transaction costs. Consistent with processing complexity driving the return relation, we further show that the more complicated the firm, the more pronounced the return predictability. In addition, we find that sell-side analysts are subject to these same information processing constraints, as their forecast revisions of easy-to-analyze firms predict their future revisions of more complicated firms.",
