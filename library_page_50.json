            "abstract": "In a market with symmetric information about fundamentals, can information-based trade still arise? Consider bond and FX markets, where private information about nominal cash flows is generally absent, but participants are convinced that superior information exists. We analyze a class of asymmetric information - inventory information - that is unrelated to fundamentals, but still forecasts future price (by forecasting future discount factors). Empirical work based on the analysis shows that inventory information in FX does indeed forecast discount factors, and does so over both short and long horizons. The immediate price impact of shocks to inventory information is large, roughly 50 percent of that from public information shocks (the latter being the whole story under symmetric information). Within about 30 minutes the transitory effect dies out, and prices reflect a permanent effect from inventory information that ranges between 15 and 30 percent of that from public information.",

            "abstract": "Abstract This paper concerns an investigation on the multifractal features of liquidity in China's stock markets based on multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis, and an analysis on multifractal features of market liquidity and fractal degree by determining the generalized Hurst exponent. Also involved in this paper are the identification of the trended fluctuations by tendency entropy dimension and a study on the validity of the correct rate of identification by stochastic correct rate. The results show that the multifractal features of liquidity are obvious in China's stock markets and that the multifractal liquidity degree of the large-cap stock is lower than those of the medium and small-cap stocks. The trend entropy dimension can be used to identify the trend of liquidity effectively, serving as an effective method to identify the fluctuation trend of fractal market.",

The results reveal significant differences in upward and downward multifractality, indicating asymmetric multifractality regardless of the frequencies. Moreover, we find evidence of excess asymmetry in multifractality for both markets and for all frequencies, which is more pronounced during downward stock price movements for Hang Seng Index (HSI) markets. The Hong Kong market is less inefficient than Chinese markets. Additionally, Bitcoin (BTC) volumes and BTC trading capitalizations affect the efficiency level across quantiles. Finally, robustness tests confirm our results are robust.",

We employ an unrestricted two-regime threshold autoregressive (TAR) model with an autoregressive unit root based on bootstrap methods. Using weekly observations, our findings indicate that weekly ISE-100 data is non-linear and characterized by a unit root process over the period January 1999 to January 2009. To test the presence of non-linear dependence, we apply the BDS test to the residuals of estimated TAR model and reject the null hypothesis of independently and identically distributed (IID) assumption. The main result is that the paper rejects the random walk hypothesis for the Istanbul Stock Exchange.",

The results indicate that there is no relationship between changes in stock return volatility and industry sectors after opening margin trading. The different firm sizes make the TSE and OTC non-electric sector's stock return volatility has significant variation earlier than electric sector's when we prolong the investigate period. For turnover rate, opening margin trading can increase the TSE's turnover rate significantly. The result also shows that considering both sectors and firm sizes, they still have different turnover rates in the mid- and long-term. In addition, opening margin trading does have information content on the stock returns. During the event window, the electric sectors of both TSE and OTC have higher stock returns. All sectors except the OTC's non-electric sector have positive impacts by opening margin trading. It follows from what has been said that the TSE's electric sector is a better investment target during our sample period and its CAAR increases more in the bull market than in the bear market.",

            "abstract": "This paper investigates the relative strengths of complementary and substitution effects between earnings and dividend announcements on a sequential sample of announcements of earnings and dividends from U.S. firms. The empirical results support the complementary hypothesis for earnings announcements that precede dividend announcements. Specifically, when evaluating an unexpected dividend signal, the investors tend to consult prior earnings information and react positively. Further tests find this complementary correlation to be stronger when accompanying negative, unexpected dividend signals. In contrast, I do not find complementary or substitution effects between dividend announcements that precede earnings announcements. In addition, the evidence indicates significant information content for unexpected revenue after controlling for unexpected earnings and dividends.",

For markets with more than two assets, these portfolios are not functionally generated (except for the identity permutation), so we use rank-based methods to analyze their behavior. The reverse-wighted portfolio is the permutation-weighted portfolio with weights proportional to the market weights, but reversed by rank. We show that in a market represented by a first-order model with rank-symmetric variance parameters, the reverse-weighted portfolio will outperform the market portfolio over the long term. This result carries over to a commodity futures market with rank-based parameters similar to those of such a first-order model. In this market we find that the reverse-weighted portfolio outperforms the price-weighted market portfolio from 1977\u00e2\u0080\u00932018.",

Studying the differences could be useful in understanding dissimilarity between the two markets. This paper is devoted to analyze certain company specific and market factors that may influence premiums between A and H shares. An appropriate factor model is built based on a sample from 63 listed companies in both markets from January 2014 to June 2017. Our factors are useful to explain premium variations. In addition to typical market and company specific factors, it is found premium levels are significantly related to the industry sector in general. Meanwhile, it is observed that premiums of many shares are becoming narrower in recent years, which might pave the way to convergence after closer links between the Mainland and Hong Kong stock exchanges.",

            "abstract": "Abstract We examine the effects of the 2008 financial crisis on the cross-market efficiency of the Hong Kong and Shanghai stock markets. Our results show a sharp decline in the cross-market efficiency during the financial crisis. We investigate whether this is due to lower internal market efficiency or higher market co-movement. The results show no evidence that the internal market efficiency dropped in Hong Kong or Shanghai during the crisis. In contrast, we document a strong increase in the market co-movement during the crisis. These results suggest that the decline in cross-market efficiency during the financial crisis is due to increased market co-movement and not a decline in internal market efficiency.",

I find strong persistence in overnight and midday-recess returns, with both returns positively associated with each other. Moreover, these out-of-trading-hours returns are negatively associated with returns during trading hours. I analyze whether these associations are explained by a different investor clientele outside trading hours (the open of the trading session) compared to during trading hours (intraday and closing of the trading session). I find that institutional ownership increases more with returns during trading hours; the finding indicates that those returns are mainly determined by institutional investors, while midday-recess and overnight returns, that is, returns outside trading hours, are not. Overall, my results support the view that market closures do affect cross-sectional returns and the influence is attributable to differences in the investor clientele.",

The study reveals a positive and significant January effect for each country except Japan. February, April and July effects are positive and significant only in the case of Indonesia, South Korea and Malaysia respectively. The findings confirm the persistence of ARCH and GARCH effects in the monthly return series. Moreover, the asymmetric GARCH models show that the emerging Asian stock market returns exhibit asymmetric (leverage) effect. The seasonal or monthly effect in stock markets in Emerging Asian countries poses an important research question as Emerging Asia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economic footprint has been growing significantly. The findings of the study have important implications for active and profitable trading strategies.",

We find that before 2013 liquidity is low and the Hurst exponent is less than 0.5, indicating that the Bitcoin time series is anti-persistent. After 2013, as liquidity increased, the Hurst exponent rose to approximately 0.5, improving market efficiency. For several periods, however, the Hurst exponent was found to be significantly less than 0.5, making the time series anti-persistent during those periods. We also investigate the multifractal degree of the Bitcoin time series using the generalized Hurst exponent and find that the multifractal degree is related to market efficiency in a non-linear manner.",
