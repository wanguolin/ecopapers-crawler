            "abstract": "This study is an investigation of the factors affecting the average returns of stocks that were traded on the Athens Stock Exchange for the period July 2004 - June 2011. The methodological approach is similar to that applied by Fama and French (1992), in the first stage, stocks are grouped into portfolios with predefined criteria, and subsequently monthly cross sectional regressions are carried out, according to the Fama-MacBeth approach (1973). The main result of this study is that average stock returns in the ASE are not associated with the market beta (market risk) and there is not a strong relationship with any other risk factor for the stocks market value or book to market ratio.",

            "abstract": "Efficient Market Theory has been the single and controlling theory of portfolio management for many years. But the Behavioural Finance discipline has challenged the assumptions of Efficient Market Hypothesis, particularly the investor rationality concept. It has incorporated emotion and psychology too into investment behaviour study. The January effect -or the abnormally large returns on common stocks in most months of January- has been one of the most intriguing issues in financial economics. Behavioral finance attempts to give some explanations about these anomalies as psychological and emotional factors involved in the stock market and that affect the behavior of investors and the market efficiency. In this article, January effect known as market anomalies is tested by power ratio method which is developed by Gu (2003). Monthly logarithmic returns of years 2009- 2016 for XU100, XUHIZ, XUMAL, XUSIN ve XUTEK Indexes are used in the analysis. Consequently, except one, existence of January effect is found at five of four indexes in Turkey stock market.",

            "abstract": "Several studies have focused on the relationship between the R2 and the firm value. They have tried to explain how different values of R2 affect the firm value. In this paper we examine this relationship for the Greek companies listed on the Greek Stock Exchange, analyzing a sample of 135 listed companies for the 2004-2010 period. The results reveal that R2 is inversely related to the firm value. This is consistent with the model of Dow and Gorton (1997). Moreover, we found that companies with high R2 have significantly higher returns than those with low R2, over a two year period time, which is inconsistent with the findings of Stowe and Xing (2011). Moreover, this research shows that the investment decisions are likely to be based more on investor psychology rather than an analysis of firm-specific information.",

            "abstract": "Many studies dealing with calendar market anomalies have ascribed positive or negative patterns detected in returns to investors? moods. However, in these studies, mood was not measured directly but rather speculated upon or inferred. This paper suggests capturing investors? moods by dividing the information contained in the VIX, popularly called the fear index, into two components: that which is correlated with volatility forecasts and information that is not. By doing so, we provide further evidence about the relationship between investor mood and risk aversion around joyful occasions (holidays) as well as for other occasions that may result in negative moods (the disruption of sleep resulting from the move to and from daylight savings time). We find that the actual values of the VIX and its cousin, the VXO, tend to be lower than their expected values in the case of joyful holidays, reflecting a more optimistic mood among investors, while during daylight savings time weekends, the actual values of the VIX and VXO tend to be higher than their theoretical values. Our results shed light on the information content of implied volatility beyond that captured in other volatility estimators.",

            "abstract": "Recent studies highlight positive effect of political connections on firm performance and stock returns. This paper shows that the positive effect of political connections on the cross-sectional stock returns disappears in the weak presidency period, defined as the last two years before the presidential party change, or period of low job approval ratings. The extent of the presidential party?s control over the Congress does not affect our main result. The result is driven by small firms, who typically do not have financial resources to hedge away political risks, and by the firms located in the states where residents more strongly support the president. Additional test suggests that the industries that rely on heavy government expenditure use a variety of political strategies to maintain the value of their political capital even during the weak presidency period.",

            "abstract": "Herd describes how individuals in a group can act collectively without centralized direction. The herd behavior on stock markets implies that investors ignore their own ideas in stock trading decisions and trade in the direction of the market. It is important to detect the effect of herding behavior in markets to assess the validity of rational asset pricing models and diversification opportunities. This paper, the validity of herding has been researched at Borsa Istanbul by considering two different models developed by Christie and Huang (1995) and Chang, Cheng, and Khorana (2000). Research data consists of daily logarithmic stock returns for the period of 1998 ? 2016. Study has been diversified by dividing the period into two sub-periods, 1998-2005 and 2006- 2016. According to obtained results, the direction that herding behavior effect has been felt intensively at the first sub-period in rising market conditions. The effect has fallen at the second sub-period.",

            "title": "Measuring herding behavior in the Russian stock market",
            "abstract": "This paper attempts to examine herding behavior in the Russian stock market by implementing four different methods designed to test for herding by Chang et al. (2000), Christie&Huang (1995), Hwang&Salmon (2001) and Torrecillas et al (2016). The main goal is to investigate the implications of the interest rate and foreign exchange fluctuations for the stock market efficiency. The results of the work help to identify the sources of herding behavior in the Russian stock market.Employing different approaches towards measuring herding, it is possible to determine whether individuals copy each other?s actions (Torrecillas et al (2016)) or herd towards market views about market index (Chang et al. (2000), Christie&Huang (1995), Hwang&Salmon (2001)). This paper starts by the establishing the transition from efficient-market behavior to herding behavior by using Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (Torrecillas et al (2016)) applied to MICEX closing prices within the period from September 1997 to December 2017. The DFA reveals the presence of persistent herding behavior during the 2007-2009 crisis. Next, Christie and Huang?s CSSD measure of stock returns is used to capture if herding related to the firm-specific risk in the portfolio is present at the market. Consistent with results of the previous studies, the method fails to establish traces of herding. Christie and Huang?s improved measure of CSSD with non-linear trend by Chang et al. (2000) yields evidence of herding in the down market during monetary policy announcements. The results of the Hwang and Salmon?s state space models help to demonstrate herding related to the market risk by analyzing relative dispersion of the time-varying betas for assets. The main finding is that changes in the betas can?t be explained by movements in fundamentals, which indicates intentional herding. Therefore, bad news for the stock market (interest rate increase and currency depreciation) induce intentional herding in the Russian stock market. Intentional herding during market stress has important implications for portfolio diversification for both diversified and undiversified investors.",

It was considered as a criteria of financial success the companies that create value and consecutive growth in three years in net incomes, the market price and Operative Economic Generation. The findings showed that the parametric models MDA and Logit, are limited because of their statistical assumptions, specifically in normality required in the exogenous variables, unlike the ANN which are not subjected to parametric conditions. The results show that although all financial ratios have an interest in obtaining financial success, there are some that have more influence than others, and that in using ANN is possible to consider the total financial ratios, without discarding any.",
