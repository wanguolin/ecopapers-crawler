            "abstract": "The objective of this paper was to explore the relationship between IPO returns and performance on the U.S. Equity Exchanges from 2005 to 2015. To conduct this analysis, we used two independently drawn samples, a primary sample, which ran from 2005 to 2015 and, an out of sample comparison, which ran from 1996 to 2008. While conducting our analyses we incorporated a new heat variable and compared its ability to describe aggregate issuance and performance against a standard heat variable, we illustrated how events can affect IPO issuance and performance and incorporated those events into a model of performance and volume, and to incorporate these events into our models we integrated the spline regression technique into our model, which improved the fit of our model substantially over methods that could be seen as alternative modeling techniques. We believe that our use of events in the modeling process provides a more accurate representation of the underlying dynamics of the processes that are causing changes in IPO performance and issuance and that our application of the spline regression technique to model IPO performance and issuance provides researchers with an important tool that could help them to better estimate, model, and understand the true determinates of IPO performance and issuance.",

            "abstract": "Second order stochastic dominance pairwise efficiency could be considered as a milestone among the improvements, which eliminates the shortcomings of mean-variance theory. This paper applies mean-variance optimization on the global fossil fuels stocks, as a leading representative of energy sector, with the help of the pre-elimination of second order stochastic dominance pairwise inefficient stocks. The performance of the application is additionally measured with an out-of-sample back-testing analysis, which indicates a contribution to the existing literature; second order stochastic dominance pre-elimination method increases the success of some of the selected mean-variance optimized portfolios on the efficient frontier which stand out with a better back-testing performance.",

We find strong evidence of institutional bias in analysts\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 forecasts, specifically, when analysts move between sell-side employers and independent employers, they issue more accurate forecasts while they are employed by independent firms. Moreover, these differences persist when we hold constant the set of firms these mobile analysts research. We find statistically significant differences in the forecast accuracy of sell-side and independent analysts. The optimistic bias of sell-side analysts appears to be related to underwriting activity. Analysts employed by lead underwriters produce less accurate forecasts for newly public companies than do either buy-side or independent analysts. The optimistic bias persists for a five-year period following an IPO.",

            "abstract": "Elon Musk, one of the richest individuals in the world, is considered a technological visionary and has a social network of over 110 million followers on social media platform Twitter. He regularly uses his social media presence to communicate on various topics, one of which is cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin or Dogecoin. Using an event study approach, we analyze to what extent Musk's Twitter activity affects short-term cryptocurrency returns and volume. In other words, we investigate whether cryptocurrency markets exhibit a \u00e2\u0080\u009cMusk Effect\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Based on a sample of 47 cryptocurrency-related Twitter events, we identify significant positive abnormal returns and trading volume following such events. However, we discover that on average, price effects are only significant for Dogecoin-related Tweets but not for Bitcoin. This is because regarding the latter, the significant price effects of positive and negative news cancel each other out. Considered in isolation, non-negative tweets from Musk lead to significantly positive abnormal Bitcoin returns. Individual tweets do raise the price of Bitcoin by 16.9 % or reduce it by almost 11.8 %. Our study shows the significant impact that the social media activity of influential individuals can have on cryptocurrencies. This suggests a conflict between morals, risks of market manipulation and investor protection.",

In our model, speculators assess the novelty of their information based on recent price movements, and market makers are aware that speculators might be trading on stale news. An asymmetric response to past price movements ensues: after price increases, buy volume\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dbecause it may result from stale news trading\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009dhas a lower price impact than sell volume (and vice versa after price decreases).

For less actively traded stocks, when bad news is reported after the market closes, potential informed trading exists, along with heightened return reversals and market inefficiency before the release. These informed trading activities are partially responsible for the post-announcement preopening price adjustments. Although the after-release preopening period for inactive stocks does not significantly facilitate price discovery as much as for active stocks, it provides an environment to resolve order imbalances after overnight information.",

Following this notion, I propose simple market efficiency measures in foreign exchange (FX) markets. The first measure considers the market to be inefficient when positive (negative) order flows predict the appreciation (depreciation) of a base currency. The second measure considers whether predictions using order flow result in tangible gains. These measures are related to liquidity levels and information factors in FX markets, unlike the measures in previous studies.",

            "abstract": "Treasury futures, important tools in interest risk management, need to maintain price equilibrium between different varieties. In this paper, we conduct research on ten-, five-, and two-year Treasury futures in China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s futures market. The auto-regression model is used to fit and predict the spot yield, the CTD (cheapest to deliver) price is used in valuing Treasury futures, and the transaction cost and market friction are considered in building the arbitrage-free spread interval. By comparing the amount of deviation and the equilibrium reversion speed, we analyse the inter-variety price equilibrium between Treasury futures. We find that there are many arbitrage opportunities among the three varieties, and the market is not fully efficient. Through further analysis of the pairwise spread relationship of the futures, we conclude that longer operation of the Treasury futures market will lead to higher market efficiency, shorter duration of arbitrage opportunities, and a faster return to equilibrium. The existing literature mainly focuses on the equilibrium relationship between two Treasury futures in statistical terms, but this paper examines the equilibrium relationship between all existing varieties of Treasury futures in China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s market based on pricing, which expands the subject and methods of research on inter-variety equilibrium in Treasury futures.",

We discover that illiquidity levels are significantly enhanced around both the earnings and post announcement period, in both the short and long run.

We find that bondholders react negatively to a late filing announcement but this negative reaction is conditional on whether late filing firms appropriate wealth from bondholders through shareholder distribution. Moreover, we find that the impact of financial distress and covenants on bond values is mainly driven by the wealth appropriation from bondholders. The results are robust to difference-in-difference analysis using treatment (i.e., late filing) and control (i.e., non-late-filing) samples based on propensity score matching. The results provide evidence that shareholder distribution as a specific form of wealth appropriation from bondholders to shareholders has a significant effect on bond values when financial information is not timely provided to capital markets.",
