            "abstract": "Abstract This study examines the asymmetric spillovers, quantile connectedness, and dynamic inter-dependence structures among the leading European Dow Jones sustainability markets (Belgium, Europe, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and Spain). We used the quantile cross-spectral approach of Barunik and Kley (Econom J 22:131\u00e2\u0080\u0093152, 2019) and the quantile connectedness analysis of Ando et al. (Manag Sci, 2022) to achieve our objectives. The results show a positive short-term dependence between European and country-level sustainability markets during bearish and bullish market scenarios. The dependence is higher in the long term than in the short and intermediate terms in bearish markets than that for bullish markets. The return spillover is higher during bearish market conditions than during bullish ones. The sustainability indices of Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands (only at lower quantiles), and Finland are net receivers in the system under bearish and bullish market conditions, whereas the remaining indices are net return transmitters in the system.",

            "abstract": "The renewable energy market has developed into a distinct asset class that has garnered significant attention from investors worldwide. This study investigates the connectedness between the S&P 500 and various energy sectors, including the Green Bond (Green Bond), S&P GSCI Carbon Emission Allowances Index (GSCI EUA), S&P GSCI Biofuel (GSCI Biofuel), and S&P Global Clean Energy Indices (Global Clean Energy). Combining the quantile connectedness approach of Ando et al. (2022) and the spillover index developed by Chatziantoniou et al. (2022), we investigate the quantile time-frequency connectedness among these markets. Our findings reveal that the impact of tail risk spreading to the energy sector during extremely challenging market conditions is significantly amplified. Most tail risk spillovers between the energy sectors involve short-term risk spillovers, as seen by analyzing the frequency domain. The impact of tail risk spillover is stronger during extreme situations, showing a short-term asymmetry. Global Clean Energy and the S&P 500 play important roles in spreading risk to other sectors, known as tail risk spillover. They add to the overall risk that affects the network system. On the other hand, other energy sectors (GSCI EUA and GSCI Biofuel) as well as green bonds act as net recipients by receiving the risk rather than spreading it further, potentially providing portfolio diversification. It is essential to understand how these key players influence risk in the financial system. Utilizing a variety of techniques to assess portfolio performance shows the importance of understanding the return transmission mechanism in the process of developing a portfolio and suggests that Clean Energy, given its relative independence, may make an excellent diversification investment.",

            "abstract": "\"Weather can have profound effects on economic activity, most obviously agriculture, construction, and transportation. It has also been reported that the daily weather in New York City affects U. S. stock returns, a clear challenge to the efficient market presumption that rational investors will not let their assessment of a stock\u00e2\u0080\u0099s value be swayed by whether the sun happens to be shining. Studies claiming to have found a sunshine effect are clouded by differing methodologies which may have been chosen to buttress the results. We examine a fresh set of data and confirm the existence of a New York City sunshine effect which may have weakened over time as trading has become more geographically dispersed.\"",

            "abstract": "This paper examines the long-run performance of French initial public offerings (IPOs) carried out between 1991 and 2005. Using various methodologies, we found that IPOs in our sample performed poorly relative to the comparison portfolios over the 1991\u00e2\u0080\u00932005 horizon in contrast to that reported by prior studies of the French market. This abnormal long-run performance is more severe for orphan IPOs (those without financial analysts\u00e2\u0080\u0099 recommendations) than for non-orphan IPOs the first year following the offerings (a statistically significant difference). In contrast to the widely held belief, this evidence suggests that analyst coverage is indeed not important to the issuing firm. Investors pay more attention to non-orphan IPOs when they are not book built, venture capital backed, underwritten by a large syndicate and less underpriced. Over the 1991\u00e2\u0080\u00932005 period, an analyst\u00e2\u0080\u0099s affiliation does not appear to matter. This result is inconsistent with the conflict of interest hypothesis. During the first year of issuance, analysts\u00e2\u0080\u0099 recommendations are associated with the success of a newly public firm. However, once we extend the horizon to 3 or 5 years after the issuance, we can find that analysts\u00e2\u0080\u0099 recommendations are not significantly related to the long-run performance of IPOs.",

The premium is not caused by systematic differences in risk or liquidity. Using Merton's (1987) investor recognition hypothesis as a guide, we find the magnitude of the premium is generally associated with country and firm characteristics hypothesized to affect returns subsequent to a change in a stock's visibility. We also characterize the time-series properties of the premium and consider economic trading strategies.",

            "abstract": "This paper develops a simple but general methodology to estimate the expected intertemporal marginal rate of substitution or \"EMRS\", using only data on asset prices and returns. Our empirical strategy is general, and allows the EMRS to vary arbitrarily over time. A novel feature of our technique is that it relies upon exploiting idiosyncratic risk, since theory dictates that idiosyncratic shocks earn the EMRS. We apply our methodology to two different data sets: monthly data from 1994 through 2003, and daily data for 2003. Both data sets include assets from three different markets: the New York Stock Exchange, the NASDAQ, and the Toronto Stock Exchange. For both monthly and daily frequencies, we find plausible estimates of EMRS with considerable precision and time-series volatility. We then use these estimates to test for asset integration, both within and between stock markets. We find that all three markets seem to be internally integrated in the sense that different assets traded on a given market share the same EMRS. The technique is also powerful enough to reject integration between the three stock markets, and between stock and money markets.",

We find patterns in abnormal returns in the days around a director's trade that are consistent with directors engaging in short- term market timing: they sell (buy) after an increase (decline) in prices, and their trades are followed by a partial price reversal. This provides strong evidence that directors trade to exploit patterns in share prices. We also find positive gross, but not net, abnormal returns to imitating some of the trades of directors once transactions costs implicit in the bid-ask spread are taken into account. We also report that some types of trades have superior predictive content over future returns. In particular, we find that medium-sized trades are more informative for short-term returns than large ones, consistent with Barclay and Warner's (1993) \"stealth trading\" hypothesis.",
